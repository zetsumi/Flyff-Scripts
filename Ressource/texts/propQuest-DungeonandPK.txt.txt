IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000484	Sprinkle this liquid on the Roach Queen egg to wake her up. Be careful.

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000488	The Roaches appeared very suddenly in the mine. Maybe you can find out the reason by going deeper into the mine.

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000509	Ribenuum is made when a Green Trillipy eats a stone and metabolizes it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000510	Would you bring me some Ribenuum? A Green Tillipy is dangerous but you look equally as dangerous.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000511	Green Trillipy are in the room to the right of the exit of the mine. The room to the left is blocked.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000512	Are you kidding me? Go on and get out of here, I may not look it but I am an old Dwarpet and I do not have time for games.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000513	Ahhh...you brought the Ribenuum. But what is this? It is flawed!
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000514	How hard is it to bring me what I asked for? 30 pieces of Ribenuum?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000515	Gather 30 pieces of Ribenuum

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000520	Refine Ribenuum
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000521	The Ribenuum you brought is impure. I could take it home and refine it myself but the other Dwarpets would laugh me back to Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000522	It will have to be refined in a human village then. There is only one human I trust to do it it right. There is man named Nein, he was one of the last humans to work in these mines. Maybe the very last human.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000523	Bring this Ribenuum to Nein and have him refine them. Then bring them back to me, would you?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000524	I heard that Nein lives somewhere in the Dead Walderness. He will refine the 30 pieces of impure Ribenuum into 10 pieces of high quality Ribenuum.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000525	Are you kidding me? Get lost! I do not have patience for games!
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000526	Oh…Thank you, thank you, thank you! Take this necklace and some money with you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000527	Hmmm…maybe I was asking too much of you. You can just go home.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000528	Gather 10 pieces of high quality Ribenuum

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000533	Bring Triduum
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000534	Ribenuum is useless to most humans. Maybe you have a Dwarpet friend you can give it to? Here, let me see it. These samples are too impure and even I cannot refine them without the right materials.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000535	I need a special metal called Triduum in order to refine this. You can get it by hunting Violet Trillipy but they live deep in the Dekane Mine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000536	Well…If you really need the Ribenuum refined bring me 20 Triduums. You are going to need a special ID card to go in there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000537	Go and get an ID card from the guys I used to work with.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000538	Ha ha ha.You can do that if you need to. I hope you are not doing this for some Dwarpet.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000539	Here is your refined Ribenuum. But, a word of warning, if the Dwarpet Kazen asked you for this…he is thinking more than he is saying.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000540	Kazen has hated humans for as long as I have known him and him working with you means he is on to something big. You know…there is a rumor that he had a hand in all the deaths in that mine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000541	You let me know if he is acting suspiciously. Maybe I can do something to help you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000542	Why not just let it go? Go home and get some rest.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000543	Get the ID card that will allow you into the room with the Violet Trillipy. Hunt them down and bring 20 pieces of Triduum to Nein.

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000549	What? You want to know where the Violet Trillipy live?  You seem so curious about this accursed mine. Unfortunately, there are not many people left who know much about it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000550	Only a few of the mine workers go that deep into the mine. I know about them or the ID card they use to get down there. Oh! You would do better to visit Bernard.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000551	Would you please say Hi to Bernard for me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000552	No, you are right. You should not be the next one to suffer.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000553	Violet Trillipy…. Do you mean you are going in there with them?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000554	Why not just relax and give it up?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000555	Find the mine workers and ask them where the ID card is.

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000561	Look, I have no problem giving you the ID card…I just do not want to see you die…But if you really insist, then fine. Hunt some Watangka and I will give you the card.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000562	If you can hunt Watangka you can probably hunt Violet Trillipy.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000563	Bye bye then! Take care of yourself…
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000564	Hmm…Violet Trillipy may be stronger than Watangka.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000565	Alright, here is the ID card. Just make sure you come out of there alive. I do not need a guilty conscience.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000566	I guess we all get tired sometime.?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000567	Get the ID cards and hunt Violet Trillipy.

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000573	Excuse me. If you are not busy, would you please listen to my story? Have you ever heard of the Ivillis Temple?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000574	The Ivillis Temple was built by the followers of Ivillis, a leader from before the first age of Madrigal.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000575	The temple is located in the Fantasy Desert, in the southern part of Saint Morning.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000576	You see…every mayor has to explore all the Islands of Madrigal. In the course of these travels we have to visit the Ivillis Temple but.. I am so afraid.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000577	Would you please help me? I beg of you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000578	Thank you! Please, investigate the entrance of the temple for anything dangerous. Would you?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000579	I cannot force you to help me if you are busy. But maybe, when you have the time, you could come back and help me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000580	Thank you, you did a great job.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000581	It is very easy to find the entrance of the temple in Fantasy Desert.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000582	Investigate the temple entrace.

IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000584	Temple of Crowns
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000585	Oh.. Back so soon? I am glad you are back but I am still so worried.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000586	I guess I am still worrying about the Ivillis Temple. I know you said that there is nothing to worry about but I still have a bad feeling about that place.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000587	Would you please help me once more? I will not be able to rest until I know for sure…
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000588	I heard that there is a copy of the Ivillis Revelation in the temple. Please bring me a rubbed copy of it, I need to see what it says.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000589	..but I.. I..need your help…
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000590	This…this is more shocking than I could have imagined. Bubble please protect us.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000591	There is a copy of the Ivillis Revelation in the Ivillis Temple. Bring a rubbed copy of it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000592	
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000593	The Revival
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000594	What should we do?! What should we do?!
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000595	I read the revelation and it speaks of the revival of Ivillis as the trigger to the end of the world!
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000596	If this is true, we have to stop it! This could be worse than the Hero Wars of long ago.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000597	You told me that you saw new types of masquerpets while you were getting the revelation right? I think that maybe…
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000598	..they are the scouts of the army of Ivillis. It looks like we may have to work together for a little while longer. Are you willing to help?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000599	Excellent. Go in to the temple and gather any information you can about the strange masquerpets.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000600	What?! Are you really going to stand by and let the world end? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000601	Hmm.. Ivillis Crasher.. So, that is one of the masquerpets? Alright, give me some time to study this information. Thank you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000602	Any information about any marcquerpets is good.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000603	Go into the temple and gather any information you can.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000604	
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000605	Into the Dark
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000606	Hi. I have studied the information you brought me and I have found that there is an altar in the Ivillis Temple. There is also evidence that there are masquerpets guarding the altar.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000607	Do you see? They do not want anyone to interupt the revival of Ivillis. We need to do something. We need to stop them!
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000608	Are you ready for one last journey into the dark?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000609	I knew you would be. There is a masquerpet name Ivillis Guarder. If you can defeat it, you can enter the altar.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000610	Are you serious? What could be more important than saving the world?
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000611	Great job, now you can enter the altar. I am counting on you to defeat to followers of Ivillis. We all are. Go to the altar now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000612	I do not know exactly where Ivillis Guarder is. But we have to find it and destroy it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000613	Defeat Ivillis Guarder and enter the altar.
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000614	
IDS_PROPQUEST_DUNGEONANDPK_INC_000615	If you can defeat the Ivillis Guarder you can enter the altar.
