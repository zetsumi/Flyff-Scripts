IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000225	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000226	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000227	Hmm... I wasn't too cold, was I?

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000244	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000245	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000246	Saint Pang gave me a gift for saving Roli Pang!  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000247	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000248	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000249	Whew!   What stinks?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000250	She hasn't changed her clothes in 6 months? I should visit Ismeralda in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000251	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000252	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000253	Why do these folks have an aversion to clean clothes?  I'll need to go see Herth.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000254	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000255

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000268

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000270	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000271	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000272	I've uncovered some interesting information.  I need to talk to Bozman.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000278	The Mystery of Saint Holy, Part Two
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000279	Upon further inspection, the letter H appears on the ribbon.  I wonder if this means Herth knows something…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000280	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000281	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000282	Okay, there's Herth. I should talk to her.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000283	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000284	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000285	Herth finally confessed to stealing Saint Holy but she wants me to keep it a secret!  I suppose I should visit Helena.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000286	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000287	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000288	That's interesting.  I wonder if Helena already knew about all this.  She never asked me who was responsible.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000329	Mon Book 1 is a book detailing the birth of Clockworks.  Do I really need to know all this?  Where should I go?  Flarine or Sain City?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000330	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000331	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000332	You know, they look very similar.  If he really wants a guild cloak, he should just go join a guild for heavens sake!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000333	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000334	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000335	Of course, Mon Book 3.  Like I really needed another book to read…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000336	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000337	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000338	Ugh, Mon Book 2.  There is no way I'm reading all this.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000339	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000340	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000341	I went through all that for a measly piece of stone?  Ah well... Clockworks, prepare to meet your doom!

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000345	Do you know the story of the heroes that saved Madrigal? Of course you don't!  It happened a very long time ago. I, too, have much to learn.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000346	There is something about you...  I foresee great things in your future.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000347	We are playing Legend of Heroes.  You should come see it sometime.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000348	Oh, you're an Acrobat?  I'm sorry, but this particular request is not for Acrobats.  Hurry to Darkon village and find out what you can do there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000349	You'll need to see Sage Radion.  He loves to travel but, if you hurry, you might catch him in Flaris.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000355	The Path of Heroes, Part Two
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000356	Madrigal holds many secrets.  I have lived here for over 1000 years, but there are far more secrets than answers in this world.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000357	Do you really want to be strong one day?  You need to try a lot harder than that.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000358	Everything will be done as it should be done.  You just have believe.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000359	Ancimys love to gamble.  Well, all they play is Rock, Paper, Scissors. However, you can find them by the floating island in Flaris, near the giant tree in Sain City, and in the vicinity of the Crane Machinery in Darkon.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000427	Excuse me, do you go into this mine very often?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000428	Yes, I understand.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000429	I see. Well, I have been tasked with finding evidence of problems with the masquerpets in the mine.  However, I am extremely busy out here.  Will you enter the mine and look for anything out of the ordinary?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000430	You certainly look well prepared.  Anyway, if you find anything, please let me know right away.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000431	Thank you. Please investigate the mine as soon as possible.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000432	Hmm, it would be nice to help others from time to time.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000433	If you enter the mine, I pity the Masquerpets. (Only Lvl. 20 -50 characters can do this dungeon quest.)

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000469	Vagrant Master
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000470	So you want to be an Acrobat, huh?  You won't regret it!  I have a simple test for you before starting the training.  Are you ready? …hic!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000471	For starters, let's go with something easy.  I would like you to hunt 10 Small Aibatts.  If you're willing, I'll teleport you back to Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000472	Good luck! You'll need it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000473	What are you afraid of?  The path to become an Acrobat may be difficult for some, but it's so worth it!  Come back if you change your mind, friend.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000474	Well done.  You've passed the first test!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000475	I'm still waiting for you to hunt 10 Small Aibatts.  If you want to become an Acrobat, you must complete this simple task.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000476	You have already chosen to pursue another path.  I cannot help you any further.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000477	For starters, let's go with something easy.  I would like you to hunt 10 Small Aibatts.  If you're willing, I'll teleport you back to Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000478	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000479	Acrobat Weaponry
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000480	Now it's time for the next step on your path to becoming an Acrobat.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000481	I want you to return to Flarine and collect 10 Twinkle Stones from Aibatts in the area.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000482	Once you've gathered the Twinkle Stones, bring them to Pyre near the Quest Office in Darkon.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000483	Good luck!  You're going to need it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000484	You must like being a Vagrant.  It would certainly be a shame if you quit now.  I'll be here if you have a change of heart.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000485	Thank you for the Twinkle Stones, Apprentice.  I will cover Acrobat weaponry with you now.  Acrobats are able to wield both Bows and Yo-Yos.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000486	Bows are long range weapons that consume arrows for each shot.   The strength of the basic shot is determined by how long you wait before releasing the arrow.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000487	Yo-Yos are also long range weapons.  However, the strength of the basic attack only changes depending on special skills used in conjunction with them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000488	If you met with Hent, then you should probably have something for me, hmm?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000489	Gather 10 Twinkle Stones and deliver them to Acrobat Master Pyre near the Darken City Quest Office.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000490	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000491	Acrobat Skills
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000492	That about does it for Acrobat weaponry.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000493	Now for the next step in your journey.  I want you to travel to Flaris, and visit the High-Dwarpets.  They have important information for you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000494	The High-Dwarpets can be found north of Flarine.  Check your map (M Key) to find your way if you get lost.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000495	Good luck, apprentice.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000496	What a shame to waste such potential.  Come see me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000497	Hmmm, has Pyre instructed you to see me?  I see.  Very well, I will continue your training.  Listen up!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000498	Bows consume Magic Points (MP) and yo-yos consume Focus Points (FP).  There are 6 special bow abilities and 7 special yo-yo abilities.  I shall teach you a common Acrobat ability, Dark Illusion.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000499	This ability allows you to vanish from sight.  However, keep in mind that any actions performed while under the effects of this ability aside from movement will remove the effect.  Take this.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000500	It's interesting that you've come to see me.  Did Pyre send you?  If he did, you would have something for me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000501	Visit High-Dwarpet Tucani in Flaris.  He can be found north of Flarine.  Check your map (M Key) to find your way if you get lost.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000502	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000503	An Acrobat's Duty
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000504	You've learned many things since your journey began.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000505	Now for the next step in your training.  There is a creature named Shuraiture near the entrance of Darkon who is causing some trouble for residents there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000506	Shuraiture has been terrorizing some of the locals in Darkon.  I want you to go there and put an end to him once and for all.  Bring news of your victory to Tailer, the Acrobat Trainer in Darkon.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000507	Good luck, you'll need it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000508	What's the matter?  Chicken?  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000509	Shuraiture is… no more?  What great news!  Thank you so much!  I see that you've also spoken with Tucani.  Here is your reward for defeating Shuraiture.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000510	Acrobats are very versatile.  We can fight at long range or in close quarters!   We also have a special ability which allows us to pull an enemy target up close.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000511	You've done well.  I sense great potential in you.  Congratulations, Acrobat!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000512	Why have you come to see me?  Did Tucani send you?  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000513	There is a creature named Shuraiture near the entrance of Darkon.  I want you to go there and put an end to him.  Bring news of your victory to Tailer the Acrobat Trainer in Darkon.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000515	Successor of the Hero - Master
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000516	You think you have what it takes to be a successor of the Jester Hero?  We will see…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000517	Fine, I'll humor you.  Slay 20 Drillers southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.  They must be regular Drillers, not the small or captain variety.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000518	Show me what you can do and I might consider allowing you to continue on the path of the Jester Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000519	That's too bad because I sense potential in you.  You must not be ready for the challenges that lie ahead.  Come see me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000520	Not bad, Acrobat.  Not bad at all.  You may have something to offer.  I'll allow your training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000521	I doubt you have what it takes to be a Jester if you can't even slay 20 Drillers.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000522	You are already on a different path.  You cannot become a successor of the Jester Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000523	I'll need to see what you can do before I'll allow your training.  Slay 20 Drillers southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.  They must be regular Drillers, not the small or captain variety.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000524	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000525	Successor of Hero - Ring
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000526	Here is a Letter of Recommendation.  You will need to give this to Radyon, the Jester Wise Man in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000527	Radyon can be found at the Fountain of Dead Person north of the River of Weeping.  Before meeting with him, you need to find the ring he lost and return it to him.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000528	Far to the south of Sain City, lies the Fantasy Desert.  It is believed that a gentleman named Ren is in possession of the ring.  Slay Ren and bring the ring to Radyon.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000529	I hope I'm right about you.  Don't let me down!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000530	I guess I was wrong about you.  You're not ready to walk the path of the successor of the Jester hero.  See me again when you think you're ready.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000531	Is that… the ring?  My goodness, thank you so much!  This ring belongs to the Jester Hero Curenen.  Ren has always wanted to acquire this ring, or so the story goes.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000532	After the war ended, and Curenen passed on, Ren searched for this ring for hundreds of years.  He finally discovered it a couple of years ago.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000533	Have you met Lorein? If you did, you should have something for me.  Think carefully.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000534	Meet with Radyon, the Jester Wise Man at the Fountain of Dead Person in Flaris.  First though, slay Ren and get the ring from him. He can be found in the Fantasy Desert south of Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000535	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000536	Successor of Hero - Scroll
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000537	My sincerest gratitude once again for finding the ring.  However, now I'll need you to take it to Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000538	Visit the Pepoview Troupe near the town square and speak with Clackcable.  Present him with the ring and he will guide you from there.  He may even give you something in return.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000539	You possess great potential, young Acrobat.  Keep working hard and you will realize your dream.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000540	Foolish Acrobat!  Don't you realize your potential?  See me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000541	Thank you so much for finding the ring! We are performing the ancestral ceremony of Curenen.  This ring will complete the ritual.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000542	Here, you certainly deserve this.  It is the Successor Scroll of the Jester Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000543	If you spoke with Radyon, didn't he ask you to bring me something?  I'm sorry, I'm very busy and we don't have much more to discuss, I'm afraid.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000544	Bring Curenen's ring to Clackcable of the Pepoview Troupe in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000545	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000546	Successor of Hero - Altar
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000547	This scroll is the right of passage for those seeking to pursue the path of the Jester Hero.  Please, take it and seek the Jester Priest in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000548	The Jester Priest can be found in Magmient in Southern Darkon 3.  Present her with the scroll and she will recognize you as a successor to the Jester Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000549	There is one thing you must do before you can speak with the Jester Priest.  The Jewels of the Heroes adorn the Altar of Jester.  One of these jewels was stolen a few days ago.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000550	The jewels protect the soul of the Jester Hero, but they will not work if one of them is missing. The creature, Sisif, was seen near the alter a few days ago…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000551	It is believed that this creature has stolen the jewel.  Find Sisif and return the jewel to the Jester Priest, Homeit.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000552	Good luck, Acrobat!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000553	The jewel must be returned to the Altar of Jester.  We need your help, Acrobat.  Speak with me again when you are ready.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000554	This is the Seal of Curenen and the Jewel of the Jester Hero.  Thank you for returning this most prized artifact, Acrobat.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000555	Now we can protect the Soul of the Hero safely.  I am in your debt.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000556	I am waiting for someone who will bring me the Jewel of the Jester Hero.  Do you have it?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000557	Take the Successor Scroll of the Jester Hero, slay Sisif to retrieve the Jewel of the Jester Hero, and bring them both to the Jester Priest, Homeit.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000558	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000559	Successor of Hero - Guardian
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000560	Great job, Acrobat.  For the final leg of your journey, you must confront the Venel Guardian.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000561	The will of the heroes is preserved in the Room of the Guardian in Guardiane.  This is where you will find the Venel Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000562	The Venel Guardian is a soul that protects the will of the heroes.  Defeat him, and obtain the Venel Heart.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000563	Take this.  It is a Mark of the Hero.  Once you have confronted the Venel Guardian and retrieved the Venel Heart, bring both of these to the Jester Guardian, Heingard.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000564	I wish you luck, Acrobat.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000565	This is the final test to becoming a successor of the Jester Hero.  You can't give up now.  Speak with me again when you are ready to continue.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000566	Congratulations, young Acrobat.  I've heard many great things about you.  You've completed the final test.  You will now become a Successor of the Jester Hero!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000567	Wise Curenen! This Acrobat wishes to follow your path!  Grant them your blessing and courage, Jester Hero!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000568	You have not completed the tasks given to you by the Jester Priest.  Return to me when you have done so.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000569	Defeat the Venel Guardian, and deliver the Mark of the Hero and the Venel heart to the Jester Guardian, Heingard, in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000570	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000571	Successor of Hero - Master
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000572	You think you have what it takes to be a successor of the Ranger Hero?  We will see…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000573	Fine, I'll humor you.  Slay 20 Drillers southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.  They must be regular Drillers, not the small or captain variety.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000574	Show me what you can do and I might consider allowing you to continue on the path of the Ranger Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000575	That's too bad because I sense potential in you.  You must not be ready for the challenges that lie ahead.  Come see me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000576	Not bad, Acrobat.  Not bad at all.  You may have something to offer.  I'll allow your training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000577	I doubt you have what it takes to be a Ranger if you can't even slay 20 Drillers.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000578	You've already chosen a different path.  I cannot guide you on the path of the Ranger.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000579	I'll need to see what you can do before I'll allow your training.  Slay 20 Drillers southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.  They must be regular Drillers, not the small or captain variety.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000581	Successor of Hero - Letter
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000582	Here is a Letter of Recommendation.  You will need to give this to Kimel, the Ranger Wise Man in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000583	However, first you must retrieve the Letter of Hynan from Rubo, a creature found to be living with Syliacas, east of Darken.  Locals caim Rubo has been seen with the letter.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000584	Once you've slain Rubo, bring the Letter of Recommendation and the Letter of Hynan to Sage Kimel at the Fountain of Dead Person in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000585	Good luck to you, Acrobat.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000586	I guess I was wrong about you.  You're not ready to walk the path of the successor of the Ranger hero.  See me again when you think you're ready.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000587	Is that… the Letter of Hynan?  My goodness, this is wonderful!  Thank you so much, Acrobat!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000588	Hynan lost this letter during the war.  There were rumors that a creature named Rubo was in possession of it.  Thank you for retrieving it for me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000589	My sincerest gratitude.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000590	I'm waiting for someone to bring me a letter.  There are rumors that a creature named Robu who lives with the Syliacas east of Darken was last seen with it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000591	You need to speak with Kimel, the Ranger Wise Man at the Fountain of Dead Person in Flaris.  First, though, you must retrieve the Letter of hynan from the creature, Rubo, East of Darken.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000592	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000593	Successor of Hero - Scroll
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000594	Many thanks for bringing me the Letter of Hynan!  I would like you to deliver it to High-Dwarpet Liekyen.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000595	High-Dwarpet Liekkyen can be found near the northwestern edge of town in Darken.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000596	You possess great potential, young Acrobat.  Keep working hard and you will realize your dream.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000597	Foolish Acrobat!  Don't you realize your potential?  See me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000598	Hello, I am Liekyen.  A former steward of the Hynan family.  I now administer the keepsakes of the Hynan family.  What have you got there?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000599	The Letter of Hynan?!  This was the last lost keepsake of the Hynan family.  How did you… no matter. The important thing is that it has been returned.  I have been looking for this for a very long time.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000600	Now all of the keepsakes of the Hynan family are accounted for.  Here, take this.   This scroll will prove that you are ready to become a successor of the Ranger Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000601	I'm waiting for someone to deliver a letter to me.  Do you have it?  No?  Then our business is concluded.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000602	Take the Letter of Hynan to High-Dwarpet Liekyen in Darken.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000603	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000604	Successor of Hero - Altar
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000605	This scroll is the right of passage for those seeking to pursue the path of the Ranger Hero.  Please, take it and seek the Ranger Priest in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000606	Rupin, the Ranger Priest, can be found in Aniceknight in northern Darkon 3.  Present her with the scroll and she will recognize you as a successor to the Ranger Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000607	There is one thing you must do before you can speak with the Ranger Priest.  Pranksters in the Garden of Rhisis have stolen the 8 books of the History of Heroes.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000608	These books detail the History of the Heroes and are very sacred us.  Go now, to Rhisis, and do what you must to get these books back!    
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000609	Good luck to you, Acrobat.  May the Ranger Hero guide you.  Speak with Rupin, the Ranger Priest in Aniceknight, once you've recovered the sacred texts.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000610	The books must be returned.  We need your help, Acrobat.  Speak with me again when you are ready.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000611	What've you got there, Acrobat?  A Stamped Scroll, and are those… they are!  I can't believe it!  The 8 lost books of the History of Heroes!  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000612	How did you ever… never mind!  The important thing is that we have them back!  We owe you our sincerest gratitude, young Acrobat!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000613	I'm waiting for someone who has allegedly found the 8 lost books of the History of Heroes.  Is that you?  No?  Then we have nothing more to discuss.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000614	Bring the Stamped Scroll and the 8 lost History of Hero books to Rupim, the Ranger Priest in Aniceknight in Darkon 3.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000615	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000616	Successor of Hero - Guardian
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000617	Great job, Acrobat.  For the final leg of your journey, you must confront the Venel Guardian.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000618	The will of the heroes is preserved in the Room of the Guardian in Guardiane.  This is where you will find the Venel Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000619	The Venel Guardian is a soul that protects the will of the heroes.  Defeat him, and obtain the Venel Heart.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000620	Take this.  It is a Mark of the Hero.  Once you have confronted the Venel Guardian and retrieved the Venel Heart, bring both of these to the Ranger Guardian, Kailreard.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000621	I wish you luck, Acrobat.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000622	This is the final test to becoming a successor of the Jester Hero.  You can't give up now.  Speak with me again when you are ready to continue.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000623	Congratulations, young Acrobat.  I've heard many great things about you.  You've completed the final test.  You will now become a Successor of the Ranger Hero!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000624	Wise Hynan! This Acrobat wishes to follow your path!  Grant them your blessing and power, Ranger Hero!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000625	You have not completed the tasks given to you by the Jester Priest.  Return to me when you have done so.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000626	Defeat the Venel Guardian, and deliver the Mark of the Hero and the Venel heart to the Ranger Guardian, Kailreard, in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000627	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000628	The best wine, Beaujolais!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000629	Some of the grapes grown in Madrigal are used for wine. Especially the wines which are made from Flaris variety, Saint variety, Darkon variety are
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000630	named Beaujolais and you can get mysterious power when you drink them, according to the legend.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000631	It seems like these 3 kinds of grapes have a magical power from the earth. I studied them for a long time.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000632	But we do not have these grapes right now, even though it is harvest season. The monsters came and took them all.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000633	Therefore we can not drink the wine that we have been waiting for. In addition the monsters will get the magical power. Would you bring the grapes back?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000634	Oh thank you. There are 3 kinds of grape divided by where they are grown. Please gather 20 grapes of this area because I cannot brew wine with the grapes from other areas.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000635	Hmm.. I cannot brew wine until the ban on making Beaujolais is lifted.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000636	Oh! I can brew a little bit of wine with these! Thank you. I want to reward you with 1 bottle of Beaujolais Flaris which was made from the grapes other adventurers brought.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000637	You can find out how it tastes, just try some yourself!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000638	Is this all? It is not enough to brew wine. I need 20 grapes at least. Please!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000639	..And if you have the grapes from the other areas..you should deliver them to the person who brews wine in that area.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000640	Oh thank you. There are 3 kinds of grape divided by where they are grown. Please gather 20 grapes of this area because I cannot brew wine with the grapes from other areas.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000670	The Path of the Mercenary
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000671	What?!  Hahaha!  You think you have what it takes to be a Mercenary?  Oh, that's good …hic!  I think you'd be better off as a comedian!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000672	You're still here?  Ugh… fine.  I'll humor you just this once.  If you think you are strong enough to be a Mercenary, then I'll need you to do a little something for me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000673	Small Aibatts have been infesting our crops just north of here.  We need someone to go exterminate some of those filthy things.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000674	Slay 10 Small Aibatts and return me when you are finished.  Understand?  Now get out of here, vermin!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000675	Good luck, Vagrant.  You'll need it!  Hahaha!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000676	I knew you were all talk, Vagrant.  That's 30 seconds of my life I won't be getting back…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000677	Hmmm, that's acceptable.  Not bad, Vagrant!  Although, I could have done it in half the time.  But that's neither here nor there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000678	Hahaha!  As if you could ever hope to compare yourself to me… Mustang the Great!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000679	What's the matter?  You're not afraid of some Small Aibatts, are you?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000680	Alright, listen carefully.  Just north of here, there are several Small Aibatts.  Slay 10 of them and return to me.  Got it?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000681	<Mustang mumbles something under his breath about you being… not so bright.>
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000682	I cannot train you to be a Mercenary.  You have already chosen another path.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000683	Slay 10 Small Aibatts just north of Eastern Flarine and return to Mercenary Drillmaster Mustang.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000684	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000685	Mercenary Arms
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000686	I suppose you've proven you're not completely useless.  On to the next task!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000687	I want you to gather the materials needed for making the weapons of the Mercenary.  Try not to mess this one up, alright?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000688	Collect 5 Twinkle Stones from Aibatts in the area. They should be relatively easy to find.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000689	Once you've gathered enough Twinkle Stones, bring them to Andy, the Mercenary Master in northern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000690	Good luck!  You're gonna need it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000691	Are you afraid of a couple Aibatts?  I know they stink and all... but really?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000692	Great job acquiring the Twinkle Stones, Vagrant.  Oh, and don't worry about old Mustang.  He's all bark and no bite!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000693	A Mercenary can use both swords and axes.  They each have strengths and weaknesses.  Swords strike fast, but deal only moderate damage, whereas axes deal heavy damage but at a moderate speed.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000694	Which weapon suits you best?  That's a decision only you can make, young Vagrant.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000695	You need to acquire 5 Twinkle Stones before I can continue your training, Vagrant.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000696	Gather 5 Twinkle Stones from the Aibatts and bring them to Andy, the Mercenary Master in northern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000697	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000698	Mercenary Skills
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000699	You've done very well so far, Vagrant.  You are ready for the next step in your journey to become a Mercenary!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000700	You must travel north, and visit with the High-Dwarpets.  Langdrong, one of the High-Dwarpets, will continue your training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000701	High-Dwarpet Langdrong will educate you on Mercenary skills.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000702	You can find the High-Dwarpets north of Flarine.  Check your map (M Key) if you get lost.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000703	I sense great potential in you, Vagrant.  Luck be with you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000704	What a shame.  Please see me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000705	Where did you find that, Vagrant?  Tell you what, for bringing this to me, I will go over one of the Mercenary Skills it details here. Listen up!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000706	As a Mercenary you can wield two weapons at once.  The skill, Keenwheel, is a high damage spinning attack that can only be used after using the Slash skill and must be used in the Action Slot. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000707	Bloody Strike is another example.  Notice how the skills in the Skill Tree Window (K Key) are shaped like puzzle pieces?  This is a good indicator of what skills can be used in what order.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000708	If Andy sent you, then he should have given you some proof.  Maybe you're forgetting something, friend?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000709	Speak with High-Dwarpet Langdrong.  He can be found with the other High-Dwarpets north of Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000710	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000711	Duty of Mercenary
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000712	So... are you starting to understand how a Mercenary works now?  Don't lose that Label of Technique I gave you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000713	Now for your next test!  There is a creature named Babari just south of Flarine terrorizing the citizens there.  Slay him, and seek out Hyuit, the Mercenary Instructor in Eastern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000714	Be careful, I hear Babari packs quite a punch! 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000715	Good luck!  You're gonna need it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000716	You can't give up now, Vagrant!  You've come so far already!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000717	The citizens of Flarine are in your debt, Vagrant!  Now the children of Flarine can play outside without having to worry about being eaten by that big bully!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000718	Mercenaries are experts at close combat.  We have the ability to stop an enemy's movement in order to close distance and keep them in range.  This ability is called, Sneaker.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000719	Our main strength is in one on one combat.  If we can get within range of an enemy, you can bet they are going to feel it the next day!  Welcome to the fold, Mercenary!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000720	May I help you?  I'm waiting for a pupil to take care of a little problem for me.  I'm guessing that's not you?  Then we have nothing further to discuss.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000721	Slay Babari and speak with Mercenary Instructor Hyuit in Eastern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000722	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000723	Vagrant Master (Assist)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000724	So you want to be an Assist, huh?  I don't blame you.  It's the best job in Madrigal!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000725	First, I want you to take care of a little something for me.  Small Aibatts have been eating our crops lately.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000726	Just north of here, there are several Small Aibatts.  Slay 10 of them and return to me as soon as possible.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000727	Good luck, Vagrant!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000728	Having a change of heart?  That's alright, come speak to me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000729	Excellent work!  Hopefully they'll stay away from our crops now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000730	You've done very well so far.  Keep up the good work!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000731	Hurry!  There isn't much time!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000732	You've already chosen another job.  I can't help you any further.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000733	Slay 10 Small Aibatts just north of Eastern Flarine and return to Assist Drillmaster Elic.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000734	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000735	Arm of Assist
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000736	You've done well so far, Vagrant.  But I have another task for you if you are willing.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000737	For your next task, I need you to gather some materials which are used to create Assist weapons.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000738	Retrieve 5 Forforms from Mushpangs and bring them to Maki, the Assist Master in Northern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000739	The Assist Master is with the Madrigal Job Masters in North-Fl. Go!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000740	Good luck, Vagrant!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000741	I guess some people just aren't suited to be an Assist.  That's alright, young one.  Speak with me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000742	Thank you for delivering the Forform, Vagrant.  Now, on to your next lesson.  Assist weapons include Knuckles or Sticks. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000743	A Knuckle is a fist weapon used for close-quarters combat, and the Stick is used to perform certain Assist skills, such as healing. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000744	It's important to remember that you must have the right weapon equipped to perform certain abilities.  With enough practice, a good Assist can switch weapons in combat seamlessly.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000745	I'm sorry, I'm waiting for someone to bring something very important.  Is that you?  I didn't think so.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000746	Gather 5 Forforms from Mushpangs and deliver them to Maki, the Assist Master in Northern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000747	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000748	Assist Skills
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000749	Now that you have a good understanding of Assist weaponry, I'd like you to visit Goripeg, one of the High-Dwarpets north of Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000750	High-Dwarpet Goripeg will give you information on Assist skills.  He knows a lot about Assists and I think you are ready to speak with him.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000751	You can find the High-Dwarpets by opening your map (M Key).  Go quickly, young one!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000752	May Bubble protect you and guide you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000753	If you feel that you are not ready, young one, that is your decision.  If you change your mind, come and speak with me again.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000754	Erhm… hello there!  You must be the young apprentice Maki spoke so highly of.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000755	The blessing of Rhisis be with you, apprentice!  I'd like to go over one of the Assist skills with you.  Haste is a skill that you can cast on yourself or an ally.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000756	The Haste skill allows you to increase your attack speed, or that of a friend's, by a very large amount.  It is an amazing skill!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000757	Excuse me?  I don't believe we have anything to discuss.  Please leave me in peace.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000758	Visit High-Dwarpet Goripeg north of Flarine.  Check your map (M Key) if you get lost.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000759	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000760	Duty of Assist
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000761	Here… take this.  It's a Label of Technique.  It details what I've told you today.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000762	Now, for the final leg of your journey, apprentice.  A creature called Chaner has been terrorizing the locals near the Demians in Madren Town.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000763	Slay him, then return to Assist Instructor Kidmen in Eastern Flarine.  She will conclude your Assist training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000764	Good luck to you, apprentice!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000765	No?  What a shame.  Speak to me again if you have a change of heart.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000766	Chaner is… gone?  Great work!  Now, listen carefully.  I have something very important to tell you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000767	The role of an Assist on the field of combat is primarily party support, however, an Assist can also prove to be a potent fighter as well.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000768	Congratulations, my friend!  You are now an Assist!  Welcome to the fold!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000769	I'm waiting for word that Chaner has been destroyed.  Last I heard he is still on the loose in Madren Town.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000770	Travel to Madren Town, east of the High-Dwarpets, and slay Chaner.  Once Chaner is defeated, speak with Assist Instructor Kidmen in Eastern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000771	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000772	Vagrant Master (Magician)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000773	Are you intrigued by the art of magic?  If you're speaking with me, you must be interested in becoming a Magician.  I must warn you, it is not an easy road.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000774	Very well then, first, I would like you to perform a small task for me.  Captain Aibatts have infested the area north of Eastern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000775	If you're interested in helping, I'll teleport you to Flarine so that you can take care of this little nuisance.  Will you slay 10 Captain Aibatts to help us?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000776	Thank you!  Good luck!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000777	I see you're not ready to walk the path of the Magician.  Very well, speak to me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000778	Great job, young Vagrant!  I think you'll make a fine Magician.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000779	You must defeat 10 Captain Aibatts to prove you are worthy of Magician training.  I will not help you if you cannot even complete this simple task.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000780	I'm afraid you've already chosen a different job.  We have nothing more to discuss.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000781	Slay 10 Captain Aibatts and return to Wingyei, the Magician Drillmaster in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000782	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000783	Weapons of the Magician
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000784	Nice work taking care of those Captain Aibatts for us.  Now, on to your next task!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000785	I need you to collect some materials for me and deliver them to Hee, the Magician Master.  She will instruct you on the use of Magician weaponry.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000786	Gather 10 Twinkle Stones from Aibatts near Flarine and then you may speak with Hee.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000787	The Magician Master is located just north of Martin's Magic Shop in West Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000788	Good luck to you, Vagrant!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000789	I see you're not quite ready to continue down the path to becoming a Magician.  Speak with me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000790	Thank you for delivering the Twinkle Stones, Vagrant.  Wingyei has told me a lot about you.  Now, let me tell you a little something about Magician weaponry.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000791	Magicians can use both wands and staves.  A wand allows the magician to attack from a distance with a charged up attack that deals additional damage while a staff can be used as a melee weapon.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000792	You will find that Magicians primarily rely on magic spells to deal damage.  However, it is important to know how these weapons work.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000793	I am waiting for someone to deliver some materials I require for Magician weaponry.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000794	Gather 10 Twinkle Stones from Aibatts near Flarine and speak with Magician Master Hee in West Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000795	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000796	Magician Skills
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000797	That concludes your lesson on Magician weaponry.  Now, I'll need you to visit one of the High-Dwarpets to continue your training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000798	Travel to Flarine and head north.  You'll find a High-Dwarpet camp just south of the middle of Leren Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000799	Speak with High-Dwarpet Hastan once you arrive.  If you get lost, you can check your map (M Key) to find your way.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000800	Good luck to you, Vagrant!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000801	Do not be frightened by what lies ahead.  This is your destiny.  Speak with me again if you'd like to continue your path.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000802	Greetings, young one!  The will of Rhisis be with you!  I am Hastan.  Magician Master Hee mentioned that you might be stopping by.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000803	Magicians are powerful fighters that utilize magic to defeat their enemies.  Let me go over one of the basic attacks with you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000804	Mental Strike is a very strong magic attack that consumes Magic Points (MP) in order to be cast.  This skill allows you to attack the target from a distance for a high amount of damage.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000805	Excuse me?  Who are you exactly?  I'm waiting for someone else right now.  Take a hike!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000806	Speak with High-Dwarpet Hastan north of Flarine.  Check your map (M Key) if you lose your way.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000807	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000808	Duty of Magician
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000809	You learn quickly, Vagrant!  Perhaps you will be a great Magician one day!  Here, take this.  It is a Label of Technique that details what I've explained to you today.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000810	For your final task, I want you to travel to the Saint Tree in Sain City and defeat the creature known as Seido.  He has been harassing some of the residents of Sain City as of late.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000811	Once Seido is defeated, speak with Magician Instructor Lopaze in Northern Sain City.  She will conclude your training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000812	You've done very well so far, young one.  Keep up the great work!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000813	You've come a long way just to give up when you're so close to the end.  Speak with me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000814	Great job, young Vagrant!  I think you'll make a fine Magician.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000815	As Magicians, we are most effective when attacking at long range.  Many of our skills employ the power of the elements.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000816	This allows us to take advantage of elemental vulnerabilities that our enemies may have.  Congratulations, young one!  You are now a Magician!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000817	I sure wish someone would take care of that Seido creature near the Saint Tree…  Oh, hello!  Did you need something?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000818	Defeat Seido near the Saint Tree in Sain City.  Speak with Magician Instructor Lopaze once he has been defeated.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000819	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000820	Find Red Bang Thieves
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000821	Help! Help me! My cash box... My money... It's all gone!  Someone stole my cash box! Iblis watch over me!!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000822	I was saving money in my cash box in order to buy a present for my girlfriend, but it disappeared this morning.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000823	So I have asked people, and they said that there are unknown thieves just west of the Fountain of Dead Person these days. I'm not sure I believe them though…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000824	Can you investigate and let me know?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000825	Thank you! Please bring me the evidence which proves they really exist. If you find them, that is.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000826	You only care about yourself.  Fine, I'll find someone else.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000827	So they really do exist!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000828	I think this is good evidence, but... I want something more conclusive!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000829	Find the thieves west of the Fountain of Dead Person in Flaris and return with evidence.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000830	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000831	Find Luda's Cash Box
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000832	I asked the witnesses with the evidence you have brought to me, and now it is clear they had stolen my cash box. Now the only thing I have to do is get the cash box back from them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000833	I am really sorry but please do me a favor once again?  I really need to get that cash box back. I really need to get my girlfriend a present. You see…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000834	it is our 100th day anniversary… She will be so upset if I don't. Would you please get my cash box back from them? I will reward you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000835	Thank you. Thank you very much. As I heard, one of them is keeping the cash box.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000836	You make me really disappointed. Whatever…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000837	You found it!  Thank you so much!  I'll never forget this!  Take this, it's the least I can do.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000838	Where is my cash box? You have not found it yet. Please bring it to me. I will be waiting.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000839	Recover Luda's cash bow from the Red bang Thieves at the camp west of the Fountain of Dead Person.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000840	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000841	Plot of Colack
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000842	Did you know that a huge meteorite fell nearby a few days ago? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000843	We usually refine chunks of meteorite into a very rare metal. We call it Meteoritill.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000844	It is the best material for making expensive arms or armor in Madrigal.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000845	It usually takes about 500 years to get it because meteorites don't fall every day.  However, one just fell, so now's our chance!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000846	Think you can find me some Meteoritill?  I would be very pleased to acquire some.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000847	Keep it secret, though.  I don't want the other armorsmiths to find out!  Try searching south of Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000848	Pfft!  Fine!  I'll find someone else to help me, but you better keep your mouth shut!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000849	Oh my… you found it!  Real Meteoritill! I'll be rich beyond my wildest dreams!  Muahahah!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000850	Oh, I mean uh…  I will be sure to make good use of this material.  Here's a little something for your trouble.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000851	Thanks again, friend!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000852	You didn't find any?  That's a shame.  Keep looking!  Don't give up!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000853	Find 5 Pieces of Meteoritill and bring them to Colack in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000854	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000855	Missing Play Script
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000856	Oh boy...  I am in big trouble.  How long have you been standing there? Did you hear everything I was saying?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000857	You heard?  Hmm.. Okay, I will tell you what happened.  I am in charge of play scripts for the Pepoview Troupe.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000858	The new play script called The Sky of Madrigal has disappeared.  If I don't get it back, I'll be fired.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000859	I know who stole it.  His name is Colar, and I think he did it as payback for being fired himself. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000860	Would you please do me a favor? Would you please bring me the play script from Colar?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000861	You will?!  Thank you very much!  Colar is hiding somewhere in the far east of Darkon 1.  Please find him!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000862	I knew you weren't going to help me.  Why did I even tell you all of that?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000863	What?!  What play script?  I don't have it, I swear! 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000864	Well, yes. I stole it.  A grave robber who was riding some kind of strange machine took it from me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000865	The machine was spouting steam and the grave robber was riding and controlling it.  That is why I am in this terrible situation now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000866	All I know is that he is somewhere in the far east of Darkon 1.  Please find him.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000867	Colar is hiding somewhere in Darkon 1.  Find him and retrieve the play script.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000868	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000869	Looking for the Play Script
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000870	Hey! I am not lying! Why on earth do you not believe me? Okay, yes, I stole the play script, but it was for revenge!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000871	There is no evidence that I'm a liar, right?  In that case, if you want to find the play script...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000872	I think someone among them has it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000873	Hey!  You there!  Let me out of here!  Help me, please!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000874	Look, I know it's none of your business. Will you help me anyway? Please!?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000875	Oh thank goodness!  Finally I got it back! Thank you so very much!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000876	If you would have been 5 minutes longer, I would have been fired.  Whew! That was a close one!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000877	I have a gift for you for helping me out.  Please, take it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000878	Please find it quickly.  If you don't return in time, I'll be fired!  I've got 5 kids to feed!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000879	Look around for the machine spouting steam that is being controlled by a grave robber.  You may have to use force…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000880	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000881	Helper Text Book
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000882	What am I going to do?  Oh my...  What?  You're curious as to why I'm so nervous?  Actually, we Helpers have a test once every year and I'm no good under pressure.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000883	The test is very soon, and the date was just moved up all of the sudden!  I am so worried!  I'm a good helper, so I should pass and all, but I want to be the best!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000884	I have never taken first place because of that know-it-all Herth, and I absolutely must beat her this year!  I will do anything to come in first place and I need your help!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000885	So will you help me, stranger?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000886	I need lessons 1 and 2 of the Helper Text Books.  I understand that both lessons can be found in the flower bed behind the Public Office.  Will you bring it to me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000887	You know, people nowadays are only worried about themselves.  Typical…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000888	Hmmm yes!  These are the ones!  So this must be the range of possible questions, huh?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000889	Yes, it all makes sense now! This is the information I needed.  This will really help me put Herth in her place!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000890	Thank you very much, my friend!  Please see me anytime if you need my help.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000891	Do you have the Helper Text Books I need? Please hurry, the test is very soon.  I'm so nervous!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000892	The Helper Text Books can be found in the flower bed behind Public Office of Flarine.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000893	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000894	Find the Portrait of Radion
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000895	Hey!  You there!  I don't know what to do.  My drawing... My best drawing has disappeared!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000896	My hobby is collecting rare and expensive artwork.  This morning I redecorating my house and I realized my most prized drawing was gone!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000897	It is the portrait of the wise man, Radion.  There are a number of suspects and I have no idea where to begin.  What should I do?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000898	Wait a minute…  I have an idea.  Will you do me a favor?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000899	You will?!  Thank you!  I need you to speak with Helgar in Sain City.  He is a connoisseur of rare and precious items.  Perhaps he knows something.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000900	No, please!  You must help me!  I don't know what else to do!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000901	What? The portrait disappeared? Hmm... I knew this was going to happen.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000902	Rudvihil has a taste for rare and expensive things.  He's also very greedy, and lacks values. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000903	If he truly has lost it, I'll do what I can to help.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000904	Do you have something that needs my appraisal?  Let me see.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000905	Visit Helgar, the connoisseur of rare and expensive items in the Sain City Square.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000906	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000907	Evidence of the Portrait 1
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000908	I don't even like speaking of Rudvihil.  He is disrespectful and his actions go against everything I stand for.  You need to visit the High-Dwarpets in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000909	Oh, you've heard of them, then?  Well, they may be able to help us.  I've heard they have strange powers that may help us find the missing portrait.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000910	Those High-Dwarpets collect ancient books and other rare treasures. How is it they can collect these things more easily than others?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000911	The answer? They are clairvoyant.  This allows them to see and hear things that you and I cannot comprehend.  I am certain they would be able to help.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000912	Will you meet with them?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000913	Excellent.  You know where they live, right? They live in the middle of the Leren Mountains in Flaris. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000914	If you don't wish to help recover what is arguably one of the most valuable pieces of art in Madrigal, then that is your business.  It's a shame.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000915	A missing portrait you say?  Of Radion?  Yes, I have heard of it.  I will do what I can to help.  Please allow me to focus my thoughts for a moment.  Hmmmm….
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000916	I think I've found it.  Yes, this has to be the one.  Here, let me draw you a picture…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000917	I drew the face of the thieves who stole the portrait.  This is all I can do for you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000918	Now please go away.  I can only stand humans for so long…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000919	The High-Dwarpets live in the middle of the Leren Mountains in Flaris.  Please go there and meet with them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000920	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000921	Evidence of the Portrait 2
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000922	We're going to need more information if we are to find the missing portrait.  Wait, maybe Ancimys can help.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000923	Powerful black magicians once existed in Madrigal. They used black magic which is slightly different than what our modern day Magicians use.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000924	One of them made a box possessing great magical power…  Ancimys.  Some say that very same magician locked himself inside the box, hahaha!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000925	He may be able to use Psychmetria... What? You don't know what Psychmetria is?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000926	Psychmetria is a powerful black magic spell that can pinpoint the location of an object.  You must go and find Ancimys.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000927	The Ancimys you need to speak with is just south of here.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000928	What do I care if you don't do it?  It's no skin off my back…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000929	A missing portrait?  Well, isn't that exciting!  I was so bored I thought I was going to fall asleep!  Tell me more about this portrait.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000930	Alright, give me a moment… Mmmmmm, yes.  I've got it!  I see a camp… and large creatures with hammers and blades for hands.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000931	Ah ha!  It's the Red Bang Troupe camp northeast of the Mars Mine.  One of those big beasts has it!  It's difficult to get to, but I'm sure you'll manage! 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000932	Are you going to play with me? Really? Good! What will we do? Hide and Seek? YAY!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000933	Find Ancimys south of the High-Dwarpet camp and ask him to find the portrait for you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000934	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000935	Get the Portrait Back
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000936	Be careful, I hear those Red Bang Troupe members pack quite a punch.  I never liked them anyway.  They don't tell good jokes.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000937	I grow tired of those who are all work and no play.  Kind of like you.  Do you ever just have fun?  Or is everything always work, work, work?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000938	Ugh… well unless you have something funny to say, I think our business is concluded.  I need to rest now.  Black Magic takes a lot out of me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000939	What do you mean? I'm not in a bad mood.  I'm like this to everyone.  Unless you can make me laugh!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000940	Is that my portrait?!  Give it here!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000941	Wait, what? What reward?  I never said anything about a reward.  Begone, pest!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000942	Let this be a lesson to you.  Before helping someone, make sure you find out upfront whether or not there is a reward being offered.  Hahaha!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000943	You haven't found it yet?  Well keep looking!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000944	Travel to the Red Bang Troup camp northeast of the Mars Mine and recover the Portrait of Radion.  Return it to Rudvihil once you find it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000945	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000946	Bone of Wagsaac
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000947	Psssst!  Hey... You there! Over here!  Sorry for whispering, but this is a secret from the Lab of Madrigal.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000948	In the Lab of Madrigal, a secret project is underway. This is actually a disguise I'm wearing, hahaha!  This secret project has to do with cloning monsters!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000949	Why are we cloning them? Because we can, obviously!  What kind of question is that? Muahahaha!! Okay, listen.  I need something for our cloning study.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000950	You think you might be able to help me out?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000951	Perrrrfect!  In the interest of furthering our studies on Wagsaac DNA, I need some of their bones.  Bring me 10 Wagsaac Bones.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000952	You don't want to do it, eh?  Fine, I'll find someone else.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000953	Hmmm *Sniff* *Sniff*... Yep!  This is prime grade-A Wagsaac Bone right here.  Good job, sport!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000954	We've got all the time in the world.  Take your time.  We're busy developing a mix between a Mushpang and an Aibatt.  We're calling them Mushbatts!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000955	Gather 10 Wagsaac Bones from Wagsaacs south of the Saint Tree in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000956	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000957	Gene of Wagsaac
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000958	What, you thought that was it?  Oh no, I have plenty more for you to do, champ!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000959	We require more data to complete our research.  Feel like helping out again?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000960	Great!  We need 10 Gene Pieces from Wagsaacs this time.  We're close to cloning out first Wagsaac!  Get going!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000961	Don't want to do it, eh?  You kill hundreds of small animals and you're going to preach to me about ethics?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000962	Ohhh yeah!  This is good stuff!  Thanks again!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000963	Take your time, friend.  We're busy making Jack in the Giggle Boxes out of Jack the Hammers and Giggle Boxes!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000964	Gather 10 pieces of Wagsaac DNA for Heitung in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000965	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000966	Origin of Bone Bowl
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000967	*Gnarllll!* Hey! You there!  You don't know me, right?  My reputation usually precedes me.  I am the strange collector!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000968	I wanted to ask you something.  Have you ever heard of the Bone Bowl?  No, not just some random Bone Bowl.  THE Bone Bowl!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000969	I'm talking about the original cursed Bone Bowl.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000970	I am looking to acquire it.  Will you help me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000971	*Grawrrrll* Great!  Head to the Garden of Rhisis and find (Bowl Merchant) Bowler!  *SNARF!*
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000972	Oh come on!  I can pay you as much as you want!  *GNARL*
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000973	Hmmm… so the strange collector wants the Bone Bowl, huh?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000974	Hahaha!  I knew this day would come.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000975	Hello there! Are you looking for something special?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000976	Locate Bowler, the Bowl Merchant in the Garden of Rhisis.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000977	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000978	The 1st Bone Bowl
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000979	The Bone Bowl was created by a black magician a long long time ago. In a town, a woman lived with her little pet, who was named Baby.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000980	The pet went crazy and began attacking townsfolk. As a result, both of them were kicked out of the town.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000981	The woman came back to the town, but the people in town killed her pet! Then the black magician made a bowl out of the skull of her pet and cursed it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000982	The town disappeared because of the curse, and so did the bowl…but there are some that say…Well, I've already said too much.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000983	So you want the real Bone Bowl, right?  Well, you'll have to do something for me first.  Nothing in this world is free, right?  Hahaha!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000984	Good!  Bring me 10 Black Tombmarbles from Tombstone Bearers, 5 Black Spell Books and 5 Black Heroka Grass from somewhere in the Garden of Rhisis.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000985	Hey, it's up to you.  Too bad though, I could have used those items to help you with your problem…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000986	Great job!  This stuff will come in real handy!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000987	You did not bring me everything I asked. Please bring me the items I requested.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000988	Bring 10 Black Tombmarbles from Tombstone Bearers, 5 Black Spell Books and 5 black Heroka grass to Bowler the Bowl Merchant in Rhisis.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000989	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000990	Facts of Bone Bowl
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000991	To be honest, it disappeared a long time ago. It corroded because it was made of bone.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000992	That is why I asked you to bring me these materials. These are the materials that the black magician used to place the curse on the Bone Bowl in the first place.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000993	I do not have the power to curse it as strongly as the black magician did.  I can certainly curse it as much as any collector could!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000994	Now, please bring this Bone Bowl to the Strange Collector.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000995	The Strange Collector will be very happy.  Just don't tell him I had to make another one.  Hahaha!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000996	There's nothing to be afraid of!  The curse isn't contagious!  Muahaha!!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000997	You got it?!  Amazing!  Look at the craftsmanship!  And it's do well preserved!  It's as if it was made today!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000998	Great job, my friend.  This bowl is amazing!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_000999	You don't have it yet?  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001000	Take the Bone Bowl to the Strange Collector in Northern Sain City.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001002	Tears of Mother
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001003	Please help me!  My daughter has been missing for so long!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001004	My daughter disappeared a few years ago.  I have reported her missing to the Public Office and tried to find her myself, but to no avail.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001005	I have done everything I can do so far, but I'm at my wits end.  I'm even asking Vagrants for help now!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001006	Please, will you help me find my daughter?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001007	Thank you. I think you can obtain some information from Porgo, who lives in nearby Saint Hall.  He will definitely know something.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001008	*Faints*
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001009	Hmm... Jeong Hwa has not given up on finding her daughter yet. What a pity, but her daughter is not the only child who has disappeared recently.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001010	Lots of the girls from Sain City disappeared. I formed a citizen investigation team, but we failed to discover any clues.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001011	Now I am the only one left from the team, but I am still investigating the case because we'd like to bring those kids home.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001012	I am the leader of the investigation team that was investigating the missing children. But now, I am the only one left...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001013	Go to Saint Hall in Sain City, and meet with Porgo.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001014	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001015	Kids Disappeared?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001016	The case of the missing children? Hmm.. Well a few years ago, a group of young, six year old girls suddenly disappeared from Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001017	Everyone attempted to find the kids, but they all failed.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001018	I never gave up and I kept trying to solve the case.  I had discovered many things, and reported them to the Public Office.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001019	However, they rejected my findings due to the lack of evidence. So as I was gathering evidence, I suddenly came up with an idea when I saw those strange Masquerpets; Mia.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001020	Anyway, will you help me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001021	Great!  Slay 20 Small Mias and tell me what you make of them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001022	That's a shame.  I guess there's no hope for those girls…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001023	Uh huh, yes.  I see.  Okay, thank you for bringing me this information, friend.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001024	I need more information, friend.  Please slay 20 Small Mias and report back to me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001025	Slay 20 Small Mias and return to Porgo, in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001026	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001027	Facts of Mia
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001028	Argh! Curse that darn mayor!  He won't even listen to me!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001029	What's the matter, you ask? I brought him the evidence you obtained for me.  I was told it was too long ago and that nobody cares about the case anymore.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001030	How could he be so heartless?  These are children we are talking about, here!  I need to find a way to get him to look at this evidence.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001031	Would you mind helping me once more?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001032	If you bring him the evidence instead of me, maybe he will take a look at it.  I've bugged him enough about this over the years, but maybe a fresh face will do the trick!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001033	But… please, think of the children.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001034	Oh for Madrigal's sake!  Porgo never gives up!  Okay, please bring this to him and tell him never to bring this case up to me again!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001035	I tour the city everyday in order to listen the opinions of the citizens.  Have a wonderful adventure in our fair city!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001036	Speak with the Mayor of Sain City and give him the evidence from the Mias.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001037	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001038	Doll of Mia
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001039	What?  It worked?  What do you have there? Oh my… then this means…  That's horrible!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001040	Thank you very much for bringing this to me, adventurer.  I need to tell JeongHwa right away.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001041	Wait a minute, she's not going to believe me unless I have some proof.  Where can I get some proof?  Yes… That's it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001042	If her daughter is still amongst Mias, then she would still have her most prized possession.  I need it in order to persuade JeongHwa. Would you bring it to me, please?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001043	JeongHwa had a daughter whose name was Jinyoung.  Jinyoung loved her doll very much.  Perhaps I can convince JeongHwa if I can find her doll amongst the Mias...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001044	You must not know what it is like to lose a child.  JeongHwa may never know the truth about her daughter.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001045	What… do you have there?  My daughter's doll?  My poor, sweet Jinyoung.  Now I can begin to mourn.  Thank you, young one. For bringing this to me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001046	Have you found my daughter yet?  Please don't give up!  I'd give anything to see her again.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001047	Speak with JeongHwa in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001048	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001049	Uncovered Past
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001050	Yes! This is it! The report was definitely written with all the facts, but not all the facts were ever proven.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001051	And the color of some of the pages in the report are slightly different.  They must have been added later…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001052	It must be because they are trying to keep this whole thing a secret.  This is a memo that proves what has been done.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001053	The memo instructs them to change the pages in the official report and bury the original behind Saint Hall.  We're about to uncover the truth to this mystery!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001054	You think you can give me a hand with this?  We're close to finding the truth!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001055	Thank you!  If this is true, the original report was buried somewhere near Saint Hall. Please bring it to me.  Hurry!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001056	I know you don't want to get involved, but please.  Think of the children.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001057	You found it!  I will do my best to uncover the truth and bring those responsible for hiding this to justice!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001058	You didn't find it?  It has to be there.  Check again!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001059	Find the Disappearance Investigation report buried somewhere near Saint Hall and bring it to Porgo.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001060	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001061	Revenge of Red Bang Troupe
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001062	That Red Bang Troupe is making me absolutely nuts!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001063	They invaded our home and stole our family treasure, leaving only a note yesterday.  I was absolutely horrified...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001064	I was so scared I couldn't do anything about it.  They stole my family treasure, and I am powerless to do anything.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001065	If I knew this was going to happen, I would have donated it to the Public Office.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001066	What can I do now?  Is there anything you can do to help?  Please?!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001067	Are you serious!?  Thank you!  The leader of the thieves has my treasure.  Their camp is just west of the Fountain of Dead person. Please, find it and bring it back to me!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001068	Oh… okay.  Never mind then.  I guess my problems are none of your concern.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001069	My Entanale Sword!  Thank you so much!  My family treasure has been returned!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001070	This sword was made by Entanale Boineo, my great great grandfather.  It was made out of the bones of an ancient animal...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001071	I would like to give this to you in return.  Perhaps you can keep it safe from thieves better than I can.  Thank you once again, my friend.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001072	You have to find the leader of the troupe.  Only he could have done this.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001073	Defeat the Red Bang Troupe Leader west of the Fountain of Dead Person and return Luda's family treasure.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001074	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001075	Identity of Red Bang Troupe
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001076	I will never forgive them for what they have done.  I'm literally fuming with anger right now!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001077	Now that their leader has been defeated, I think this is a good opportunity to hit them where it hurts and end this once and for all!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001078	I have a plan, but I will need your help again, my friend. Are you up to it?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001079	I knew you would do it!  Travel back to their camp, and defeat 5 Red Bang Troupe Members, 1 Red bang Troupe Leader, and bring me 7 of their symbols.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001080	Will you not help me finally rid our town of this nuisance?  Speak with me again if you have a change of heart.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001081	Very good!  Excellent work!  They're probably tucking their tails between their legs now!  Muahaha!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001082	Have you defeated them all yet?  Do you have any symbols?  No?  Then you better get going!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001083	Defeat 5 Red Bang Troupe Members, 1 Red Bang Troupe Leader, and retrieve 7 Symbols of the Red bang Troupe.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001084	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001085	Troupe Leader, Lord Bang
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001086	This… this symbol… it is very intriguing.   If I'm right, the real leader of the Red bang Troupe is not the one you defeated.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001087	This symbol has been found in Darkon 2 as well.  Could the real leader of the Red Bang Troupe be hiding there?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001088	We must find out.  The leader must be defeated or this will never end.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001089	I've just received information from one of my colleagues in Darkon 2.  I believe we've identified him.  Will you help me once again, my friend?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001090	Thank you!  The information I gathered is that his name is Lord Bang.  He was last seen near the Gouthan Mountains in Darkon 2.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001091	We are so close to putting an end to this nuisance for good!  Please, help us!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001092	You defeated Lord Bang?  Thank goodness!  Now we can live without fear of his retaliation.  Thank you so much, my friend.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001093	You must hurry!  He has to be defeated before he retaliates!  Go to Darkon 2 and find him now!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001094	Travel to Darkon 2 and defeat Lord Bang.  He was last seen somewhere near the Gouthan Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001095	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001096	Special Kids
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001097	Hey!  I have some new findings in the case of the missing girls!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001098	According to this report, there is one more thing in common with the kids who disappeared from Sain City. They were all girls.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001099	But I cannot find out what the similarity is in this report.  It's really frustrating!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001100	Will you help me find out what's going on here?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001101	I need you to fight with Captain Mias and Mias and look for similarities between them, or anything you might find strange about them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001102	You won't?  Please, help me.  Speak with me again if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001103	Oh, thank you so much!  You've been such a great help so far!  I couldn't have made it this far without you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001104	Have you seen any strange similarities between them?  Keep looking!  I'm counting on you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001105	Slay Mias and Captain Mias and return to Porgo with any information you gather.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001106	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001107	Secret Trade
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001108	I found out the common thing between them based on the data you brought me.  I think it has something to do with supernatural power!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001109	These kids were all afraid of the former mayor and their parents for some reason…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001110	They were abandoned and kicked out of the city!  Wow, that can't be true, can it?!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001111	Why would mothers kick out their own kids?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001112	We have to uncover the truth in this case and make sure it never happens again.  Will you help me?!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001113	Awesome!  Speak with the mayor again, and ask him to review this Disappearance Investigation.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001114	How can you refuse to help when we are so close to discovering the truth!?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001115	Hmm... This is very intriguing new information. Very well, I'll make a special inquiry group and check the case again.  Please tell Porgo I said thanks.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001116	Sain City is being developed even today.  By the way, why did Porgo tell you to meet me?  Do you have something to show me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001117	Bring the Disappearance Investigation report to the Mayor or Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001118	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001119	Mia, the Cursed Name
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001120	We made an inquiry group and started to review the case again. I can't believe something this horrific has happened in Sain City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001121	I suppose it's better late than never.  Will you return to Porgo and let him know that we are investigating the case again?  His cooperation is appreciated.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001122	Thank you.  I will do everything I can to make Sain City more beautiful and peaceful than it already is.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001123	I tour the city every day, so I am extremely busy.  Please tell him what I said.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001124	Has the truth finally been revealed?  It has?!  I am so glad to hear that the case has been reopened.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001125	Thank you so much for your help, young one.  I couldn't have done all this alone.  The girls thank you, as well.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001126	Have you spoken to the Mayor?  Please hurry, this case needs to be reopened!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001127	Speak with Porgo and tell him the good news.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001128	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001129	Legendary Redmantis (Part 1)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001130	Hey you!  Yeah, you!  Come here for a minute…  I would like to speak with about something.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001131	My name is Rudvihil, and I am a collector or rare and expensive artifacts.  I'm always on the lookout for something new and precious.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001132	Anyway, to the point, I heard some rumors that there is a very rare artifact in Saint Morning.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001133	I intend to acquire this artifact for my collection.  I have a vast collection of artifacts and it would make a nice addition.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001134	So, what do you say?  Will you help me find this artifact?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001135	Great!  Travel to Sain City, and speak with Helgar, the connoisseur of rare and precious items.  He should be located near Saint Hall.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001136	What?  You won't help me?  Fine, get off my property, then!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001137	Hello there, are you interested in any rare artifacts?  I have an stunning ancient Aibatt carving here that is very unique…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001138	Rudvihil?  Hahaha!  That guy will never stop hoarding rare and precious treasure.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001139	Have you found anything, yet?  No?  Well hurry up!  I don't have all day!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001140	Travel to Sain City and speak with Helgar, the connoisseur of rare and precious items.  He should be located near Saint hall.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001141	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001142	Legendary Redmantis (Part 2)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001143	Hmmm, I think Rudvihil is referring to the Red Mantis Egg.  These eggs are difficult to acquire and I think these might be the eggs Rudvihil is after.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001144	There are reports that some Red Mantis C, the female variety, have been seen near the pumpkin patch.  Feel like taking a trip?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001145	Great!  Head to the pumpkin patch, slay 10 Red Mantis C and collect 15 Redyspawn.  These are the eggs.  Hopefully we'll find a pristine one!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001146	Are you afraid of a little action?  This is a very rare find, it will be worthwhile, I promise.  Let me know if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001147	Let me see what you've got there… Hmm yes, these are very nice!  Thank you for bring these to me!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001148	What are you doing here?  You have work to do!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001149	Travel to the Pumpkin patch, slay 10 Red Mantis C and acquire 15 Redyspawn.  Return to Helgar when you've completed this task.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001150	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001151	Legendary Redmantis (Part 3)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001152	Well, I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is, the Redyspawn is not that valuable.  The good news, is that I believe I know what Rudvihil is searching for.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001153	It's Emeraldispawn.  It is extremely difficult to acquire, as you can only get it once a year.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001154	In addition, it's mother is rather… protective of her eggs.  However, we're in luck!  It's breeding season!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001155	Now is our chance!  Will you retrieve this egg for Rudvihil?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001156	I knew you would!  The mother, Emeraldmantis, is located somewhere near the Central Hillid Mountains.  Find and defeat her, then retrieve the egg!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001157	What?  Why?  We're so close to uncovering a precious artifact?  Rudvihil will be disappointed.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001158	Do you have it?  Let me see it!  Oh my… it is everything I dreamed it would be.  Thank you very much, stranger!  My collection is getting better and better!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001159	Here's a little something for you.  Call it a tip!  Thanks again!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001160	Do you have it?  No?  Then get back to work!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001161	The Emeraldmantis is located somewhere near the Central Hillid Mountains.  Defeat her, retrieve the Emerald Mantis Egg, then return to Rudvihil.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001162	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001163	Internal War of Red Bang Troupe
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001164	Listen, I've been talking to some townsfolk…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001165	After Lord Bang died, I have heard various rumors about the Red Bang Troupe that lead me to believe they are still around.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001166	I can't ignore these rumors.  If there is any chance that the Red bang Troup is still in existence, we need to take care of it immediately.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001167	Will you help an old friend once again?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001168	Thank you, friend.  There are reports of Red Bang Troupe activity near the Erons Factory in Darkon 1.  I need you to investigate!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001169	I can't ignore these rumors.  Please help me!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001170	Then it's true.  It's worse than I thought.  Thank you for bringing me this information.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001171	You didn't find anything?  These rumors are unsubstantiated, but I believe them to be true.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001172	Travel to the Erons Factory in Darkon 1 and search for evidence of Red Bang Troupe activity.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001173	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001174	New Lord Bang
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001175	They still exist, huh?  I knew it.  This can only mean there is a new leader.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001176	Darn it!  We've got to do something before it's too late!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001177	Since there is evidence of a new leader, there must be a new group of Red Bang Troupe members hiding out somewhere.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001178	A good friend of mine mentioned having seen some Red bang Troupe members in the Northern Leren Mountains
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001179	I am sure that the group of them live in the Northern Leren Mountains.  Go now, friend, and see if you can identify a new group of troupe members.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001180	I know I've asked for many favors, but we are so close to putting an end to this threat.  Please, help me!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001181	I see.  There must be a new leader.  Thank you for delivering this information.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001182	Please, hurry!  We don't have much time!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001183	Search the Northern Leren Mountains for evidence of another Red bang Troupe camp.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001184	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001185	Ambition of Lord Bang
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001186	The new leader of the Red Bang Troupe must be at the Erons Factory location you discovered before.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001187	We need to strike a blow to his troupe and cripple his operations in Darkon 1.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001188	I know what to do!  You need to visit with Amadolka.  But first, defeat 35 Red bang Troupe Members southwest of the Erons Factory. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001189	Will you help me once more, friend?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001190	Great! Now please go and visit Amadolka, who is a guard leader at Erons Factory.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001191	You have to believe me! A lot of people are in danger! Do you understand??
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001192	What?  Really?  Good job thinning the herd a bit.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001193	Hmmm... you may prove useful.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001194	I am in charge of security in Erons Factory. Do you know Luda? How is he doing?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001195	Defeat 35 Red Bang Troupe Leaders and speak with Amadolka at the Erons Factory in Darkon 1.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001196	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001197	Unified Red Bang Troupe
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001198	They have occupied almost half of Erons Factory.  I didn't realize how strong they really were.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001199	We are having a hard time defending this narrow entrance, they will get through here in no time unless we do something about it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001200	We need more information!  We need a scout to survey their base and let us know what we're really up against.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001201	You seem like a good candidate for the job.  What do you say?  Want to help the people of Erons Factory?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001202	Great! I am sure their base is somewhere in the depths of Darkon 1.  Let me know what you find out!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001203	No?  Fine… We will have to deal with it ourselves.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001204	Excellent work!  So now we know where exactly their base is located and what we're up against with their new leader.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001205	Have you found it yet? We don't have much time! Please, hurry!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001206	Locate the Red bang Troupe base in Erons Factory 2, Darkon 1, and report back to Amadolka with anything you find.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001207	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001208	Legend of Dreadpet <Big Thyred>
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001209	Pssst, hey you!  I'm writing a book and I need your help.  I'm having a bit of writer's block and I need a brave adventurer to help me write it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001210	Have you ever heard about the Legend of Big Thyred? No? A long long time ago, there was very a famous adventurer named Big Thyred. One day, he found an interesting place to adventure…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001211	It was a cave deep underground, surrounded with this strange, bloody fog.  Big Thyred investigated the cave only to become infected by a disease within the cave called Horrible Fear.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001212	The disease transformed him into a hideous monster, whom we now call Big Muscle.  There's virtually nothing left of that brave adventurer but bits and pieces, or so the story goes…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001213	So, here's where you come in.  I need to an ending to the story and I'd like to know what's become of Big Muscle.  Feel like lending a hand?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001214	One of those mangy Organigors ate one of my reference books.  Defeat the Organigors at the Plain of Bubble and acquire the Book of Fear 1. While you're there, find the Fortress Map.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001215	Awwww, come on!  Look, I'll give you HALF of the sales from my book if you'll help.  Still having second thoughts? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001216	Oh, Rhisis!  You've got the Book of Fear!  Great work!  Alright, sounds like you have what it takes to face Big Muscle.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001217	Here, take this.  It's Big Thyred's Heart. \n\n#b*You drop the heart and scream!*#nb\n\nHey, careful!  You need that!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001218	Take the heart to the Dreadpet Manager just southwest of here. You'll have to join a party before you face Big Muscle, it's too dangerous to go alone.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001219	Look, I know it's scary to face the Organigor, but I believe you can do it. Go, now!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001220	Travel to the Plain of bubble, defeat Organigor, and recover both the Fortress Map and the 1st book of Dread for Novelist Gergantes in Northern Flarine.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001222	Legend of Dreadpet <Krren Dacid>
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001223	Pssst, hey you!  I'm writing a book and I need your help!  I'm having a bit of writer's block and I need a brave adventurer to help me write it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001224	Have you ever heard about the legend of Krren Dacid? A long long time ago, there was a very famous adventurer. His name was Krren Dacid. One day, he found an interesting place to adventure…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001225	It was a huge temple in the sky.  Krren investigated the temple only to become infected by a disease within the cave called Horrible Fear.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001226	The disease transformed him into a hideous monster, whom we now call Krrr.  There's virtually nothing left of that brave adventurer but bits and pieces, or so they say…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001227	So, here's where you come in.  I need an ending to the story and I'd like to know what's become of Krrr.  So whaddya' say?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001228	Great! One of those Gangards at the Plain of Bubble scooped up one of my reference books.  Defeat the Gangards and acquire the Book of Fear 2.  While you're there, try to find the Temple Map.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001229	Oh, come on now! Tell you what, I'll give you 50% of the proceeds from the sale of my book when I release it!  How does that sound?  Bah!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001230	Blessings from Bubble, you've got it!  It looks like you do indeed have what it takes to face Krrr.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001231	Here, take this.  It's Krrr's Heart. \n\n#b*You vomit all over him*#nb\n\n Hey, knock it off!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001232	If you're done being sick, take the heart to the Dreadpet Manager in Madren Town.  You'll have to join a party to enter the temple, it's way too dangerous to go alone.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001233	Look, I know Ganguard's smell bad and all that, so I understand your reservations… but I really need that book.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001234	Travel to the Plain of Bubble, defeat Gangard, and retrieve both the 2nd book of Dread and the Temple Map for Novelist Gergantes in Northern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001235	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001236	Legend of Dreadpet <Moot Arvan>
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001237	Pssst, hey you!  I am writing a book and I need your help!  I've had a little writers block lately and I need a brave adventurer to help me write it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001238	Have you ever heard of the legend of Moot Arvan? No?  A long time ago, there was very a famous adventurer, Moot Arvan. One day, he found an interesting place to adventure...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001239	It was a strange, wet marsh.  Moot explored the marsh only to become infested with a disease called Unpleasant Fear.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001240	The disease transformed him into a hideous monster known as Mushmoot!  There's virtually nothing left of that brave adventurer but bits and pieces, or so they say…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001241	So, here's where you come in.  I need an ending to the story and I'd like to know what's become of Mushmoot.  Feel like helping?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001242	Great!  One of those pesky Hadeseors at the Plain of Bubble has stolen one of my reference books!  Find and recover the book for me and see if you can locate the Boggy Map while you're there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001243	Don't be a scaredy-cat!  Look, I'll even give you 50% of the proceeds from my book sales if you help.  Okay?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001244	Yes, great work! I knew you could do it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001245	Here, take this.  It's Moot's Heart. \n\n*You begin to feel sick…*\n\n Oh shake it off, slacker!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001246	Take that heart to the Dreadpet Manager at the Eastern River of Weeping.  You'll need to form a party first, it's way too dangerous to go in there alone. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001247	Ah geez!  What are you afraid of?  A Hadeseor?  Psht!  I guess you aren't as brave as I thought you were.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001248	Travel to the Plain of Bubble, defeat Hadeseor, and retrieve both the 3rd book of Dread and the Boggy Map for Novelist Gergantes in Northern Flarine.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001250	Sad Christmas
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001251	Hmm.. We are in big trouble now. Do you know what happened? Do you? The stockings are gone. The stockings..
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001252	Are you asking why I am making a big deal about the stockings? Are you serious? These are not normal stockings, these are the Christmas stockings which have the wishes of children!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001253	A few days ago, every stocking was stolen in Madrigal. I figured out that Masquerpets did it. Now we are in big trouble.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001254	Would you please help me make a Merry Christmas in Madrigal?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001255	Thank you. Please hunt every Masquerpet in Madrigal and bring me 500 stockings. I will definitely reward you.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001257	Ha ha ha! I knew you would! Thank you so much! But.. We still lack enough stockings.. Hmm..
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001258	Hey.. I told you I need 500 stockings. I know 500 stockings are a lot, but it is not that difficult to get.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001259	Please hunt every Masquerpet in Madrigal and bring me 500 stockings. I will definitely reward you.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001274	The stockings have the wishes and dreams of all of the children. But.. But..

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001281	Please hunt every Masquerpet in Madrigal and bring me 100 stockings. I will definitely reward you.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001283	Take Ddukguk Back
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001284	Oh my God, I am in big trouble.. Psst! Hey, wait! Please listen to me. The biggest holiday in Madrigal, Lunar New Year, is coming soon.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001285	So Losha made special Ddukguk for the holiday and asked me to keep it. But the Masquerpets heard of it, and..
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001286	..and they took all of the Ddukguks away. I could not do anything because I was really terrified.. Now what should I do? Losha will kick me out if she knows this.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001287	Would you..please help me? For Lunar New Year? Please?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001288	Thank you! Please hunt every Masquerpet you can find in Madrigal and bring me 100 Ddukguks. I will definitely reward you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001289	Are you really going to kick me out? Becoming a cook is my dream. Please help me. I cannot give up now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001290	Thank you, thank you so much! Here you are. It is my little present.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001327	New Puppy Yorrn
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001328	Excuse me, can I talk to you for a moment?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001329	The pretty lady beside me is Losha, my elder sister.  I am her younger sister, Loyah. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001330	My sister has very cute puppy, but unfortunately, he's gone missing!  She originally found the puppy up in the mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001331	When she first saw the puppy, it was cold and starving.  So she brought it home and took care of it, but suddenly it disappeared one day.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001332	Since then, my sister  has been looking everywhere for the puppy.  She doesn't eat or drink or sleep. Would you please help my sister find her lost puppy?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001333	Great! She found the puppy somewhere in the middle of Leren Mountains where the Grownup Lawolfs live.  Maybe the puppy is trying to find it's way home?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001334	How could you refuse the request from a lady? You have no social manners!  Have you no shame?!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001335	Yorrn! Where did you find him? In the mountains!?  I knew it!!  He was probably trying to find his way home!  Welcome back, Yorrn!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001336	Have you found Yorrn?  No?  Well, please keep looking!  I'm worried about my sister!

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001340	Hey there, I have a problem.  Can you help me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001341	Actually I have 2 kids, one daughter and one son. My daughter has gone missing!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001342	This was several years ago with some other missing children... So, my son is the only child I have left.  However today... Today he disappeared too!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001343	Both of my kids are now missing.  I feel like I can't go on living.  Please, will you help me find my son?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001344	You're amazing!  My son used to love the Pumpkin Patch.  You should start your search there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001345	If you will not help me, then I have no other choice…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001346	Hey, who are you?  What?  My mom is worried about me?  What else is new…?  Ugh, fine.  I'll go back and let her know I'm okay.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001350	Doridori Sushi
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001351	Finally!  The time has come to learn how to make Doridori Sushi.  I just need some ingredients!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001352	I'll need to practice the recipe so that I can master it.  Oh boy, Doridori Sushi is the best sushi in Madrigal!  I can't wait!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001353	Tell you what, if you help me, I will give you some of this fantastic sushi.  How's that sound?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001354	I knew you wouldn't be able to resist! Now, bring me the following materials: 12 Doridoma Keratins and 5 Mushurines. You can get them from Small Doridomas and Captain Mushpangs.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001359	Collect 12 Doridoma Keratins and 5 Mushurines from Small Doridomas and Captain Mushpangs.  Return to SsotTta when you have the ingredients.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001361	Successor of Hero -Master-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001362	So you think you're ready to become a Knight?  It isn't easy, but since you've made it this far I think you're up to the challenge.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001363	First, a simple test of your skills in combat to see if you are qualified.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001364	Go to KhipRa and hunt down 20 Drillers.  Not the Small ones, or the Giants, just regular Drillers.  That should be easy enough.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001365	Good luck, my friend.  I'll be watching.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001366	Giving up already?  But this is the easy part.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001367	Excellent work, Mercenary!  Now you're on your way to becoming a Knight.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001368	To commemorate this day, I have something for you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001369	Exactly 20 Drillers, Squire.  That's what you'll need to take your first steps to Knighthood.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001370	Corel is your master, young Mercenary.  I can not help you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001371	Hunt Down 20 regular Drillers and return to Karandur in Darken City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001372	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001373	Successor of Hero -Helmet-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001374	This letter of recommendation is proof of your achievements thus far.  Guard it as you would your own life.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001375	Take it to Hormes, the Knight Sage.  He resides at the The Fountain of Dead Person in the Northern Leren Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001376	Before you go, though, I want you to find Kindler, a grave-robber.  He's hiding out near the Clockwork's Cage, South of Darken City.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001377	I believe he has information on the Golden Helmet of Billaon.  Retrieve it by any means, and take it to Hormes along with your letter.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001378	May the courage of Billaon be with you always.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001379	You've already come so far, why give up now?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001380	My word!  This… this is the Golden Helmet of Billaon!  We thought it had been lost forever!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001381	No one had seen it since that grave-robbing scoundrel Kindler stole it and hid it away.  Thank you, you're truly remarkable!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001382	You have a question?  Out with it, quickly.  I have no time to waste with idle chatter.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001383	Find Kindler and use whatever information he has to locate the Golden Helmet.  Then take it, and your letter, to Hormes, the Knight Sage at the The Fountain of Dead Person in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001384	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001385	Successor of Hero -Scroll-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001386	I deeply appreciate what you've already done, but alas, the Helmet's journey does not end here.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001387	It belongs with the Hersan Kurmin, in the Plain of Bubble.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001388	The Kurmin Family has managed the house and relics of Billaon for generations.  I'm sure they would reward you handsomely for its return.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001389	Time is a-wasting, Mercenary!  Hurry along, now!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001390	No time to be showered with the appreciation and riches of a wealthy family?  Very well, then...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001391	Oh my… I can't believe it....  I've been looking for this for years.  Thank you, thank you very much!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001392	I'd like to give you something for bringing this back to the Kurmin family.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001393	This Scroll has only been passed down to the Knights in my family line, until now.  I'd like you to have it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001394	What nice weather! Oh, I'm sorry, did you need to speak with me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001395	Go to the Plain of Bubble to meet Kurmin and give her the Golden Helmet.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001396	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001397	Successor of Hero -Altar-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001398	To show my gratitude, I’ll help you further along your way towards becoming a Knight.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001399	You’ll need to visit the Altar of Knight at Magmient in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001400	Lobiet, the Knight Priest, will recognize the scroll I’ve given you…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001401	But bringing her more will speak to your dedication to Knighthood.  Wheelems in the Garden of Rhisis have taken 8 stones that hold the Souls of the Heroes.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001402	Retrieve the 8 Soulstones from regular Wheelems and take them to Lobiet.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001403	Good luck, Mercenary.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001404	I know it’s a challenge, but I assure you, the reward is worth it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001405	I haven’t a clue why those Wheelems took the stones, but nevertheless, thank Billaon you’ve returned them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001406	The Souls of the Heroes can rest, thanks to you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001407	What brings you to this holy Altar for the souls of Heroes?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001408	Hunt down 8 regular Wheelems (not Bouncing or Rough) and retrieve 8 Soulstones from them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001409	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001410	Successor of Hero -Guardian-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001411	This is the Mark of Heroes.  It is a special sigil from the Guardian of the Knight’s Altar that denotes the wearer as a successor of Knight Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001412	You only need one more item to finally become a Knight.  You will find it in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001413	In Guardiane, in the Room of Guardians, you will find a spirit called the Venel Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001414	Defeat this spirit, and take his heart.  This will be your final test.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001415	Once you have completed this task, present the heart to Boneper, the Knight Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001416	I wish you luck, Mercenary!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001417	You’re almost finished, Mercenary.  Don’t give up now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001418	Well done!  I now officially bestow the title of Knight upon you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001419	Billaon, please bless and encourage this Knight as they follow your will!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001420	Only one recognized as a Knight may pass.  Please turn back.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001421	Defeat the Venel Guardian, take his heart, and present it to Boneper the Knight Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001422	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001423	Successor of Hero -Master-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001424	So you think you're ready to become a Blade?  It isn't easy, but since you've made it this far I think you're up to the challenge.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001425	First, a simple test of your skills in combat to see if you are qualified.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001426	Go to KhipRa and hunt down 20 Drillers.  Not the Small ones, or the Giants, just regular Drillers.  That should be easy enough.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001427	Good luck, warrior.  I'll be watching.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001428	Quitting already?  But this is the easy part.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001429	Hmm... Good job, I knew you could do this! Now you are qualified as a successor.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001430	Congratulations! You passed the first test.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001431	Exactly 20 Drillers, Mercenary.  That's what you'll need to take your first steps to becoming a Blade.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001432	Karandur is your master, young Mercenary.  I can not help you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001433	Hunt Down 20 Drillers and return to Corel in Darken City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001434	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001435	Successor of Hero -Earring-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001436	This letter of recommendation is proof of your achievements as a Blade-in-Training.  Guard it as you would your own life.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001437	Take it to Guabill, the Blade Sage.  He resides at the  Fountain of Dead Person in the North Leren Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001438	Before you do that, however, locate the Earring of Heren.  It’s hidden somewhere in Heret, in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001439	May the mercy of Heren be with you always.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001440	You've already come so far, why give up now?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001441	Dear me!  This… this is Earring of Heren!  We thought it had been lost forever!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001442	It had gone missing in Heret somewhere, and no one could find it.  Thank you, you're truly remarkable!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001443	Your efforts this day will be forever appreciated.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001444	The souls of many people travel to the Fountain of Dead Person. It is the crossroads between life and death.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001445	Find the Earring of Heren, hidden somewhere in Heret.  Then take it and your letter to Guabrill, the Knight Sage at the  Fountain of Dead Person in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001446	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001447	Successor of Hero -Scroll-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001448	Now to get the Earring back into the right hands, the Manager of the House of Heren.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001449	Please deliver it to Ata at the Observatory in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001450	His family has managed the House of Heren for generations, and they’ve been seeking this earring for just as long.  Possessing it again will give them great relief.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001451	Oh, I can just imagine how happy this is going to make them.  Hurry along!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001452	Delivering this earring will not only help Ata’s family, but I’m sure they’d be willing to help you in your quest.  Please, reconsider.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001453	It this…?  Oh, it is!  I can finally go home now!  Thank you, thank you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001454	You don’t know how much this means to my family!  We’ve been searching for the Earring for so long and now...forgive me for rambling, I’m just so excited!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001455	This Scroll belonged to the Blades in my family line.  Since you’re trying to become one, I want you to have it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001456	Full Moon out tonight.  Strange things usually happen when that occurs…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001457	Deliver the Earring of Heren to Ata at the Observatory in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001458	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001459	Successor of Hero -Altar-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001460	You’ll want to take it to the Blade Priest, Jeperdy.  She manages the Altar of Blades in Brekin, Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001461	Oh, since you're heading that way, could you retrieve a jewel for her called the Tear of Darkness?  A Scorpicon in the Tableland of Silence has it, and we believe it could threaten the Souls of Heroes the Altars protect.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001462	Please take it to Priest Jeperdy, and perhaps we can investigate it further.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001463	Good luck, Mercenary.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001464	Something this potentially dangerous could bring harm to the Altar of Blade.  Please, you must help us retrieve it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001465	Hmm, just as I thought.  Even Soulstones react to it.  This requires much more investigation.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001466	Worry not, young Mercenary.  Bringing me the jewel was enough on your part.  I’ll do the rest.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001467	What brings you to this holy Altar for the Souls of Heroes?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001468	Take the Tear of Darkness from Scorpicon in Tableland of Silence, Saint Morning, and bring it to Priest Jeperdy in Brekin, Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001469	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001470	Successor of Hero -Guardian-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001471	Here, take this Mark of the Heroes.  It along with one last item will denote your status as a true Blade.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001472	In the Room of Guardians, you will find a spirit called the Venel Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001473	Defeat this spirit, and take his heart.  This will be your final test.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001474	Once you have completed this task, present the heart to Sencyrit, the Blade Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001475	I wish you luck.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001476	You’re almost finished, Mercenary.  Don’t give up now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001477	Well done!  I now officially bestow the title of Blade upon you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001478	Heren, please bless and encourage this Blade as they follow your will!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001479	Only one recognized as a Blade may pass.  Please turn back.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001480	Defeat the Venel Guardian, take his heart, and present it to Sencyrit the Blade Guardian in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001481	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001482	Successor of Hero -Master-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001483	So you think you're ready to become a Billposter?  It isn't easy, but since you've made it this far I think you're up to the challenge.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001484	First, a simple test of your skills in combat to see if you are qualified.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001485	Go to KhipRa and hunt down 20 Drillers.  Not the Small ones, or the Giants, just regular Drillers.  That should be easy enough.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001486	Good luck.  I'll be watching.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001487	Giving up already?  But this is the easy part.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001488	Excellent work!  Now you're on your way to becoming a Billposter.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001489	Exactly 20 Drillers.  That's what you'll need to take your first steps to becoming a Billposter.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001490	Ellend is your master, young Assist.  I can not help you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001491	Hunt Down 20 Drillers and return to Ride in Darken City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001492	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001493	Successor of Hero -Hall Document-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001494	This letter of recommendation is proof of your achievements as a Billposter.  Guard it as you would your own life.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001495	Take it to Domek, the Billposter Sage.  He resides at Fountain of Dead Person in the Northern Leren Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001496	Before you do that, however, retrieve the Hall Document from Hoiren.  He's hiding somewhere in the Garden of Rhisis.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001497	Luck be with you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001498	You've already come so far, why give up now?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001499	Your skill must be extraordinary if you were able to take this document from Hoiren, good work!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001500	The Billposter Hero Roentel originally owned this document, but his pupil Hoiren stole it when he died.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001501	Hoiren hid it away, and no one could find it until now.  We deeply appreciate your efforts to return it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001502	Such a peaceful place...if only these other Sages would stop with their chattering I could get some writing done...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001503	Retrieve the Hall Document from Hoiren, who is hiding somewhere in the Garden of Rhisis.  Then deliver it and your letter to Domek the Billposter Sage.  You can find him at the  Fountain of Dead Person.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001504	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001505	Successor of Hero -Scroll-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001506	The rightful caretaker of the Hall Document is Segho of the Pesin family.  They have been managing Roentel’s Hall of the Martial Arts for generations.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001507	He is out of the Hall right now, doing some adventuring of his own in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001508	He’s an accomplished mountaineer, so you may be able to find him in the Leren Mountains.  Present him with the Hall Document when you find him.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001509	Good luck!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001510	Very well, then.  Perhaps someone truly worthy of becoming a Billposter will come along to deliver this for me...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001511	Surprised to run into somebody else this high up.  I’m looking for Roentel’s Hall Document, you wouldn’t happen to have heard about it… well, what d’ya know...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001512	Thanks for bringing this back to us, now I can finally get back to the Hall.  Say, I knew I had a good reason to bring this along.  Let’s see... *rummaging*
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001513	There you go.  Every Billposter in my family line possessed this Scroll.  Now it’s yours.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001514	Ahh, Leren Mountains.  The root of Flaris itself, perfect for surveying every spot on the map.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001515	Deliver the Hall Document to Segho in the Leren Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001516	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001517	Successor of Hero -Altar-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001518	Head on over to Fera, the Billposter Priest.  She manages their Altar in Arians, Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001519	She’s been looking for the Poster of Skill which contains Shadow Avatar, Roentel’s most devastating technique.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001520	Rumor has it that grave-robbers controlling the Steamwalkers have gotten a hold of it.  Take it back from them, and get it into Fera’s hands.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001521	Good luck, friend!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001522	Someone with evil intentions using Shadow Avatar could lead to catastrophe.  Please, reconsider!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001523	Well done!  People say that only Roentel can use this, but with Billposters like you around, who knows?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001524	Until then though, I’ll do my best to protect it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001525	What brings you to this holy Altar for the souls of Heroes?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001526	Retrieve the Poster of Skill from the Steamwalkers, then bring it to Fera in Arians, Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001527	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001528	Successor of Hero -Guardian-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001529	Here, take this Mark of the Heroes.  It along with one last item will denote your status as a true Billposter.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001532	Once you have completed this task, present the heart to Capafe, the Billposter Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001533	I wish you luck.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001534	You’re almost finished, Assist.  Don’t give up now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001535	Well done!  I now officially bestow the title of Billposter upon you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001536	Roentel, please bless and encourage this Billposter as they follow your will!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001537	Only one recognized as a Billposter may pass.  Please turn back.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001538	Defeat the guardian spirit, Venel Guardian, and get it's heart. Then please visit Capafe who is the Billposter Guardian.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001539	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001540	Successor of Hero -Master-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001541	So you think you're ready to become a Ringmaster?  It isn't easy, but since you've made it this far I think you're up to the challenge.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001542	First, a simple test of your skills in combat to see if you are qualified.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001543	Go to KhipRa and hunt down 20 Drillers.  Not the Small ones, or the Giants, just regular Drillers.  That should be easy enough.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001544	I will be watching you.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001550	Hunt Down 20 Drillers and return to Ellend in Darken City.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001551	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001552	Successor of Hero -Seal-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001553	This letter of recommendation is proof of your achievements as a Ringmaster.  Guard it as you would your own life.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001554	Take it to Clamb, the Ringmaster Sage.  He resides at the The Fountain of Dead Person in the Northern Leren Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001555	Before you do that, however, retrieve the Seal of Aenn from Ren near the Fantasy Desert of Saint Morning.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001556	May Aenn’s mercy be with you always.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001557	You've already come so far, why give up now?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001558	The Seal of Aenn!  Someone’s finally found the Aenn family symbol!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001559	I’d always heard that Ren would steal anything of value, but I never thought he’d have a mind to take the Seal!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001560	Your efforts are most appreciated!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001561	You're a long way from a doctor’s office… but I am still a healer of the sick and injured.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001562	Retrieve the Seal of Aenn from Ren near the Fantasy Desert in Saint Morning, then take it to Clamb, the Ringmaster Sage.  You can find him at the Fountain of Dead Person.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001563	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001564	Successor of Hero -Scroll-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001565	Now, deliver the Seal to Teshar, the leader of Kyon Soldiers.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001566	Teshar and her Mercenaries can be found in Eastern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001567	Make haste!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001568	The Seal is very important, and you’re one of the only people able to keep it safe.  Please, reconsider taking this task.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001569	Greetings, I am Teshar, and I lead Kyon’s company of soldiers for hire.  How may I help...oh my.  How did you find this?  I’ve looked all over Flaris for it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001570	In Saint Morning, really?  That explains why I never ran across it.  Anyway, thank you very much.  Please, take this as a token of my appreciation.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001571	This Scroll was passed down to each Ringmasters in my family.  I’d like you to have it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001572	Even though the Kyon are hired soldiers, we do not follow just anyone because of the money. We respect faith and royalty.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001573	Deliver the Seal of Aenn to Teshar in Eastern Flarine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001574	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001575	Successor of Hero -Altar-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001576	Now, since you’re going to become a Ringmaster, you should see the Ringmaster Priest, Heedan, in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001577	She’s been trying to track down the Teardrop of Aenn that was stolen by Hunter X.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001578	If you can get it back, you’d help her out a great deal.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001579	Hunter X is in Darkon 1. Find him, get back the Teardrop of Aenn, and take it to Heedan in Cendil, Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001580	I wish you luck.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001581	But… you must do it if you are to become a Ringmaster.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001582	Great job,  now everything is at it should be.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001583	Thank you very much. I will do my best to keep it safe.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001590	Defeat the guardian spirit, Venel Guardian, and retrieve his heart. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001591	Then, deliver the heart to Romvoette, the Ringmaster Guardian in Guardiane.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001593	You've come all this way just to give up?  This is the last step.  Please, think this through.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001594	Welcome, Assist. You've done very well! Now, I appoint you the Successor of the Ringmaster Hero!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001595	Aenn, bless and watch over this person who is following your will, Ringmaster!

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001601	First, we'll need to test your skills in combat if we are to continue down this path.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001602	I want you to defeat 20 Drillers.  Not Small Drillers or Giant Drillers, just Drillers.  They are located southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001603	I will be watching you, Magician.  Good luck!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001604	You're giving up now before you've even started? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001605	Yes, very well done, Magician.  You've certainly come a long way.  You're ready to become a Successor to the Psykeeper Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001606	I've already given you your task, my friend.  You must hurry.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001607	Horison tells me you've already chosen the path of the Elementor.  I cannot aid you.  If you have any questions, please ask her.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001608	Defeat 20 Drillers.  Not Small Drillers or Giant Drillers, just Drillers.  They are located southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001616	Yes, you found them!  Amazing!!  What…?  Do I like girl's underwear?  What a silly question!  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001617	Anyway, you did an excellent job acquiring these.  I will continue your training immediately.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001618	Well, I certainly look dashing in these! *snicker*
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001619	Now, where did I put my underwear...

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001625	Ryupang NEEDS that underwear!  Please, think it over!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001626	Hmmm… yes?  What've you go there, young Magician?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001627	The Magic Underwear of Power!  Where did you find them?  No matter, the important thing is that we now have this very important relic.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001628	Take this, my friend.  This Stamped Scroll will prove you are worthy to become a Successor of the Psykeeper Hero.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001632	Successor of Hero -Altar-

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001634	Pereb, the Psykeeper Priest, is trying to locate an ancient Relic from the war somewhere in the Eienble Cave in Darkon 2.  It's called the Trace of Offerep.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001635	Locate the Trace of Offerep, and present it to Pereb, the Psykeeper Priest at the Altar of Psykeeper in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001636	Well, what are you waiting for?  Get moving!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001637	Don't give up now, Magician.  You're so close!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001638	I am grateful that you've brought the Trace of Offerep, Magician.  I have been searching for this for a very long time.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001647	Deliver the Venel Heart to Shyniff, the Psykeeper Guardian in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001648	May the wisdom of the Heroes guide you, young one.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001649	Quitting now would be foolish, young one.  Give it some though and speak to me again should you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001650	Welcome, Magician.  Your journey to becoming a Psykeeper is now complete.  I now appoint you, a Successor of the Psykeeper Hero!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001651	Offerep, please guide and protect this brave soul who is following in your path, Psykeeper!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001652	I am awaiting a new Successor to the Psykeeper Hero.  If that is you, I believe you may be forgetting something, young one.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001653	Defeat the Venel Guardian, and deliver the Venel Heart to Shyniff, the Psykeeper Guardian in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001654

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001657	First, we'll need to test your skills in combat if we are to continue down this path.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001658	I want you to defeat 20 Drillers.  Not Small Drillers or Giant Drillers, just Drillers.  They are located southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001659	I will be watching you, Magician.  Good luck!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001660	You're giving up now before you've even started? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001661	Yes, very well done, Magician.  You've certainly come a long way.  You're ready to become a Successor to the Elementor Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001662	I've already given you your task, my friend.  You must hurry.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001663	You've already made a decision to become a Successor of the Psykeeper Hero.  You have to visit Ellend to continue your training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001664	Defeat 20 Drillers.  Not Small Drillers or Giant Drillers, just Drillers.  They are located southwest of the Gouthan Mountains.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001666	Successor of Hero -Feather-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001667	Here is your Letter of Recommendation.  This shows that the master recognizes your potential.  Do not lose this document.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001668	For your next assignment, I'll need you to Feather of Magic Power which is located somewhere in Magmient, in Darkon 3.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001669	Once you've located the feather, present it to Cuzrill, the Elementor Wiseman near the Fountain of Dead person in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001670	I pray the mercy of Lillip will always be with you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001671	Don't underestimate yourself, Magician.  The path is meant to be difficult.  Let me know if you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001672	An, yes.  The Feather of Magic power!  It is said that this was crafted by Lillip and made from the feather of a Luia.  It can double your magic power.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001673	I sure know a lot about it, don't I?  Hahaha! Thank you for finding this, Magician.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001674	I am just as clever as the Elementor Priest!   Maybe I'm even more clever than her!  I am surrounded by jealous people!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001675	Locate the Feather of Magic Power and present it to Cuzrill, the Elementor Wiseman near the Fountain of Dead person in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001676	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001677	Successor of Hero -Scroll-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001678	Now, I need you to deliver this relic to Parine, Tina's helper at Sain City Station.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001679	Take good care of that relic, and good luck!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001680	What?  You did all this just to get your filthy hands on that relic?  That's just… awful.  I'm speechless.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001681	You've found it!  Oh thank you, thank you, thank you!  Finally, I have it!  The Feather of Magic Power!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001682	You must have been through a lot to acquire this for me.  Here, I have something for you…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001683	Take this, my friend.  This Stamp Scroll will prove you are worthy to become a Successor of the Elementor Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001684	I am the scion of Lillip.  At the moment, I am learning from Tina about managing the Sain City Station. Why are you here?  Are you forgetting something?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001685	Deliver the Feather of Magic Power to Parine, Tina's helper at Sain City Station.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001686	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001687	Successor of Hero -Altar-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001688	You'll need to speak with Condram, the Elementor Priest in order to continue your journey.  However, fir you'll have to complete another task.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001689	Elementor Priest Condram is looking for something very important. It is the Perfume of Lillip, which is rumored to be somewhere in Heret, in  Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001690	Find the Perfume of Lillip and deliver the Stamped Scroll to Priest Condram at the Altar of Elementor in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001691	Good luck to you, Magician!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001692	You… won't?  Why not?  It would be a shame to let someone as gifted as you simply give up.  Speak to me again when you're ready.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001693	Ah yes, the Perfume of Lillip.  I have been looking for this for a very long time.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001694	Thank you very much, Magician.  Now the relics of the Elementor Hero are safe.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001695	This is the altar where we protect the Souls of the Heroes. What can I do for you, my friend?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001696	Find the Perfume of Lillip and deliver the Stamped Scroll to Priest Condram at the Altar of Elementor in Darkon 3.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001697	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001698	Successor of Hero -Guardian-
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001699	This is the Symbol of the Hero.  There is only one more task to complete before you can be named a Successor of the Elementor Hero.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001700	There is a place called the Room of the Guardian. You'll find it in Guardiane.  There, the Will of the Heroes is protected.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001701	You must confront the Venel Guardian, who resides there, and retrieve his heart.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001702	Deliver the Venel Heart to Wendien, the Elementor Guardian in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001703	Maybe the wisdom of the Heroes guide you, my friend.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001704	Quitting now would be foolish, young one.  Give it some though and speak to me again should you change your mind.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001705	Welcome, Magician.  Your journey to becoming an Elementor is complete.  I now appoint you, a Successor of the Elementor Hero!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001706	Lillip!  Bless and guide this brave soul who is following your will! Elementor!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001707	I am awaiting a new Successor to the Elementor Hero.  If that is you, I believe you may be forgetting something, Magician.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001708	Defeat the Venel Guardian, and deliver the Venel Heart to Wendien, the Elementor Guardian in Guardiane.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001709	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001710	Sound which calls the Dark
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001711	Have you ever heard the horrible sound from Mars Mine? That strange and hair-raising sound… It's spooky!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001712	Maybe you haven't, but you will.  Muahahaha!  I heard it clearly!!! I hope it's not the sound I think it is...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001713	(After a long hesitation...) Listen, if it is the sound I think it is, we have a big problem. Well, more like a disaster.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001714	(Holds your hands suddenly… creepy, right?) So, please, will you do me a favor?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001715	Great, please investigate the entrance to the Mars Mine, then return to me.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001716	Not interested, huh?  Fine, go play with Aibatts or something…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001717	Unfortunately it's exactly what I thought... Darn, I am still missing something.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001718	Please just investigate the entrance.  It can't be that hard…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001719	Investigate the entrance to the Mars Mine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001720	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001721	Phantom of Fear
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001722	I cannot be sure by only investigating the entrance.  I need more detailed information…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001723	(Looks at you imploringly) Would you please, please bring me more detailed information? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001724	I wouldn't ask if it weren't very, very important.  Will you help?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001725	Thank you! This time, investigate the inside of the Mars Mine.  Also, please investigate the masquerpets there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001726	It's not like I'm asking you for your first born child…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001727	Oh no…  We're doomed!  What are we going to do!?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001728	I know it sounds dangerous, but you've got to be brave.  This is very important.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001729	Investigate the inside of the Mars Mine.  Once inside, investigate the masquerpets you find.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001730	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001731	Serus Uriel
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001732	Now I'm sure it's what I feared.  I still I can't do anything about it. I need evidence... Hmm...
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001733	(Thinking for a while, and then, suddenly...)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001734	Yes! That's it! There must be evidence in the Mars Mine! We have to find it!!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001735	If the seal is broken, the broken pieces of the magic key must be there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001736	Now I know what we must do! Would you please help me once more, friend?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001737	Thank you! Collect the 5 pieces of the broken key somewhere in the Mars Mine, and return to me
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001738	Are you serious?  What part of *doomed* did you not understand?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001739	It's all clear now.  It is exactly what I was afraid of.  Serus Uriel has returned.  The Phantom of Fear.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001740	Keep looking!  The pieces of the broken key must be somewhere inside the Mars Mine!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001741	Collect 5 pieces of the broken key in the Mars Mine and return to Dr. Estly.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001742	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001743	Dangerous War
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001744	As long as Serus Uriel is still alive, it will be impossible to avoid all out war…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001745	I do not want to stain Flaris with blood again.  That's the last thing we need right now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001746	Her power can't possibly be as strong as before, otherwise she wouldn't be hiding in the mine.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001747	I need your help again.  Can you help me protect our peaceful Flaris?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001748	I do not know exactly where it is, but there is a chamber for Serus Uriel. In front of that room, there are five guardians that protect it. Please defeat them first.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001749	What the hell is more important than this? I really cannot understand!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001750	Hmm.. You are really great. I will appoint you as a punitive force of Serus Uriel. Here is the key. Please take it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001751	From now on, the conflict is with Serus Uriel.  Please, head back there and use the key to open the door to her chamber.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001752	Don't give up now, you must defeat her.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001753	Don't underestimate the 5 guardians.  They are very powerful.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001754	Defeat the 5 Veduque Guardians in front of Serus Uriel's Chamber and return to Dr. Estly to acquire the Mars Dungeon Key.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001755	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001756	Existence which Desire Summoned
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001757	So you're interested in challenging Clockworks, huh?  What're you, nuts?!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001758	Okay...if you insist. However before I help you, I need to make sure you aren't just going to walk in there and fall over dead.  I need to make sure you're worthy.  Okay?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001759	Great!  Please visit Dr. Est. He is studying the ecology of Darkon, in the nearby Gouthan Mountains of Darkon1.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001760	Backing out already?  Hahaha!  I knew you were all talk…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001761	Oh, did the Mayor of Darkon send you? You must be the one he was talking about that's crazy enough to challenge Clockworks.  Here, you'll need this book.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001762	It contains information about how Clockworks appeared here in Madrigal.  It's a good read, but not for the faint of heart.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001763	Clockworks is one of the most dangerous monsters in Madrigal!  He's huge!  I have been studying him for 4 years now, but I still don't know everything about him.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001764	Visit Dr. Est near the Gouthan Mountains in Darkon 1.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001765	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001766	Great Clockwork War - 1st
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001767	Alright, let's get started.  Have you heard of the Great Clockwork War?  You'll need to study it before you can challenge Clockworks.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001768	the Great Clockwork War is the first time the people of Darkon were faced with that terrible menace, Clockworks.  The people of Darkon were defeated.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001769	They escaped to the Erons Factory.  Evidence of this war can be found all over Darkon…  Are you ready to continue to the next step?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001770	Find 5 pieces of War Remnants in Darkon 2, and then visit my brother, Dr. Estern.  He is at the Hill of Shade in Saint Morning.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001771	I guess you truly aren't ready to face Clockworks.  Why did you waste my time?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001772	My brother sent you, right? Nice to meet you! My name is Dr. Estern, Dr. Est's younger brother. Why did he send... Oh, you're going to challenge Clockworks? Okay, do you have the War Remnants?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001773	Hmm... Five, exactly! Okay, here you are.  This book is about the study of Clockworks. It will be really useful in learning about your opponent.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001774	Yes?  I'm sorry, I think I'm waiting for someone else.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001775	Locate 5 pieces War Remnants in Darkon 2 and visit Dr. Estern at the Hill of Shade near Saint Morning
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001776	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001777	Great Clockwork War - 2nd
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001778	Now for the final step!  You've already heard about the Great Clockworks War. Actually, there was another Clockworks War after that…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001779	That time, Clockworks was defeated and captured.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001780	He was held at the cage where he was defeated by the allied forces of Flarine, Sain City and Darkon.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001781	You can see the evidence of the war in Darkon 1 and at the Plain of Bubble in Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001782	Please find 5 War Scars in Darkon 1 and the Plain of Bubble, and then visit my brother, Dr. Estly, who is in Northern Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001783	Fine, have it your way.  I guess you just aren't ready to face Clockworks.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001784	Oh, did my brothers send you to me? Then you must be the Clockworks challenger! Please, show me the War Scars.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001785	Hmmm… everything looks to be in order here! Here, take this book. It is a more detailed study of Clockworks.  It goes into detail about his behavior.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001786	I'm waiting for someone who is supposed to be bringing me something important.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001787	Find 5 War Scars in Darkon 1 and the Plain of Bubble and visit Dr.Estly in Northern Flaris.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001788	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001789	Show What You Can Do
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001790	Well, it looks like you have all the information you need about Clockworks.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001791	So, after all that, the masterpiece of Darkon was created, Clocks! What? You don't know what Clocks is?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001792	It's like a small version of Clockworks. We made it for the people who want to challenge Clockworks, so they can practice first!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001793	Since you're on your way to becoming the next challenger, why don't you practice a bit, first?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001794	Clocks' Cage is outside of Darken. You'll have to defeat it, but you'll probably need some help.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001795	I knew you were a coward!  Hahaha!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001796	Congratulations!  Now, you are ready to challenge Clockworks.  You better be prepared or you'll get squished!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001797	Don't be fooled by his size, Clocks is almost as powerful as Clockworks.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001798	Defeat Clocks, who is caged just outside of Darken.  You may need some help.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001799	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001800	Create Guild
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001801	Do you want to create a new guild? Excellent! First, I have to check if you are qualified to create a new guild.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001802	Okay, first you have to organize your own party. You should be the party leader and the total number of members should be 3, including you. Got it?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001803	Once again, make your own party. Remember that you should be the party leader and the total number of members should be 3, including you. Please visit me again once you have done this.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001804	Okay, in that case, if you decide to create a guild later, we'll be here!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001805	Hmm… Okay, lets see. You are the party leader, and there are 3 members... Good!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001806	Now I will let you create your own guild.  By the way, according to Madrigal policy, you must pay 3,000,000 Penya to create the guild.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001807	Do you have 3,000,000 Penya right now?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001808	There seems to be a problem.  Maybe you aren't the party leader or you do not have enough members.  Remember, you have to be the party leader and you should have 3 party members, including yourself.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001809	Please come back again when you have met all of the conditions for creating your guild.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001892	Confession
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001893	Angels from the heaven cannot mature by themselves. That's why they've come up with a way to share experience (EXP) with human beings.  It's mutually beneficial!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001894	If you share your experience with them, they will forgive you for prior indiscretions (PK value). How does that sound? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001895	First, summon one of the Angels with Sunstones and Moonstones.  When your Angel reaches 100% experience, bring it to me with 1,000,000 Penya. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001896	Only Angels can forgive you for your past indescretions. I am sure you will be back in the near future.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001897	Your Angel's experience has reached 100%. You, Angel, forgive this young adventurer for their past indiscretions!  They promise it won't happen again! *wink*
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001898	Defeat Masquerpets and bring your Angel's experience to 100% and bring it back to the Priest of Confession with 1,000,000 Penya!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001899	Defeat Masquerpets and bring your Angel's experience to 100% and bring it back to the Priest of Confession with 1,000,000 Penya. Your PK Value will be reduced by 1 to 5 at random.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001984	I need a dash of Cream, a pinch of Coffee, and some special sweet Sugar. You can get these items from monsters all around the world! Get me these items and I will show you power overwhelming!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001985	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001986	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001987	Ah, these are exactly what I was looking for! You have done well, adventurer. As promised, I will concoct for you a special drink that will give you a temporary boost of power! A little of this…a dash of that…stir and shake…

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_001989	What is this? You're lacking some more items, adventurer. I cannot complete the special drink without all the ingredients. Remember, I need a dash of Cream, a pinch of Coffee, and some special sweet Sugar. Come to me when you have them all.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002002	I can't let you enter the Volkane Dungeon. I don't even know who you are!  Who are you, anyway?!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002003	Alright, fine, you certainly are persistant.  If you bring me 1 Phanbubble, I will let you enter.  Can you do that?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002004	It's none of your business why I *need* them... There are Glaphans in the area and they usually carry Phanbubbles.  Defeat some of them and bring back the Phanbubble I asked you for.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002005	Hmmm… Looks like I gave you more credit than you deserved.  I mean, come on, it's just one puny Phanbubble.  Come back when you're ready, I guess.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002006	Great!  This will be a perfect addition to my collection!  Alright, as I promised, you can enter the Volkane Dungeon now.  Enjoy yourself, but don't die too quickly, okay?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002007	Are you just going to stand there or are you going to bring me that Phanbubble I asked for?

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002010	Raising Pets 1 (Egg -> D Class)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002011	Nice egg, stranger.  I'm sure you're wondering what kind of pet you'll get from it.  Well, don't get too far ahead of yourself now.  I can't guarantee you're going to be able to hatch it.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002012	However, if you really take care of the egg there shouldn't be a problem.  All you need to do is get the egg's experience (EXP) to 99.99% and then bring it back to me. Think you can do that?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002013	Sounds good!  Alright, listen.  In order to bring your egg's experience to full, you're going to need to feed it while it's summoned.  Find yourself some Pet Feed and get started!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002014	Well that's a shame.  I can't say I'm surprised, though.  From the looks of you, you probably couldn't even keep a cactus alive.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002015	Great job with the egg, stranger!  Tell you what, I'll take over from here.  It's hatching time!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002016	You're going to need to get your egg's experience to 99.99% in order for me to hatch it for you.  Feel free to stop by again once you've done this!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002017	The Pet Tamer has asked you to feed your egg some Pet Feed until it reaches 99.99% EXP.  Once you've done that, return to him and he will hatch it for you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002018	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002019	Raising Pets 2 (D Class -> C Class)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002020	Now that you're pet has been hatched, it will increase specific character statistics (Stat Points) depending on the type of pet you have summoned.  Every pet type affects a specific character statistic.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002021	Hunt Masquerpets while your pet is summoned and it will gain experience points.  If you bring your pet's experience to 99.99% again, I'll upgrade it! How does that sound?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002022	You MUST feed your pet often or it will die.  When it's health gets low, you better feed it!  Now, go and spend some time with your pet!  Come back when you've gained enough experience.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002023	Really?  You're not interested in advancing your pet's abilities?  Fine, have it your way.  What a shame…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002024	Great job with your pet, my friend!  I'll take it from here!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002025	You need to spend more time with your pet. It hasn't acquired enough experience to be upgraded yet. Stop back by when his experience reaches 99.99%!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002026	Bring your pet's experience to 99.99% and the Pet Tamer will upgrade it for you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002027	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002028	Raising Pets 3 (C Class -> B Class)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002029	The higher the level granted for a particular class (D, C, B, A or S), the higher the affected character statistic will be.  The level granted is always random.  Cool huh?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002030	C Class Pets such as this one have 3 levels available (1 - 3) and you achieved a random level during the last upgrade.  Will you see me when your pet reaches 99.99% experience again?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002031	Great!  I'll see you when you get back.  Good luck, and don't forget to feed your pet!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002032	Don't give up now, you're doing such a great job!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002033	The two of you are becoming stronger together, and it looks like you guys have become pretty good friends in the process. Excellent! I will upgrade your pet to B class now!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002034	Stop back by when your pet reaches 99.99% experience.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002035	Bring your pet's experience to 99.99% and the Pet Tamer will upgrade it for you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002036	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002037	Raising Pets 4 (B Class -> A Class)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002038	Excellent job raising your pet so far, my friend.  You two certainly look happy together!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002039	I'm sure you've noticed by now that the higher the level granted for a particular class, the higher the benefit to your Stats.  Would you like 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002040	No pain, no gain. I'm sure you know the drill by now.  Bring the experience of your pet to 99.99% and bring it back to me. I will upgrade it when your done.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002041	Don't give up now, you're doing such a great job!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002042	The two of you are becoming stronger together, and it looks like you guys have become pretty good friends in the process. Excellent! I will upgrade your pet to A class now!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002043	Not quite there… your pet needs more experience. I'm sure you already knew that.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002044	Bring your pet's experience to 99.99% and the Pet Tamer will upgrade it for you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002045	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002046	Raising Pets 5 (A Class -> S Class)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002047	I can see that you and your pet have been through a great deal together.  You're almost there!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002048	I'll upgrade your pet to *S level* using magic handed down through my family. All you have to do is get the experience of your pet to 99.99%. You've done it before, will you do it the one last time?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002049	I knew you would. It looks like both you and your pet are ready to begin.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002050	Does this mean you are giving up on your pet?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002051	Congratulations! As long as you have your pet, you will never be alone.  Your pet seems to be very happy, you've done a great job.  Now allow me to apply the final upgrade!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002052	You are so close to getting your pet to its ultimate level. Do not give up now.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002053	Bring your pet's experience to 99.99% and the Pet Tamer will upgrade it for you!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002054

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002056	You have become very strong. Do you want to become a master of your class? You will return to level 60 but as your levels grow you will become even more powerful!

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002058	Rincruet are dropped by Muffrin and Popshifts are dropped by Popcranks. Go now, brave one, and return to me as a Master.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002059	I see so much potential in you.  Are you really giving up?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002060	I knew you could do it!  You are brave, wise, and strong.  You're well on your way to becoming a Hero.  Go forth, Master!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002061	You will need to bring me the items I asked you for in order to become a Master of your class.  Return to me when you have done this.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002062	Collect 10 Rincruets and 5 Popshifts to become a Master of your class.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002066	Now, it is time for your final task.  To show me your true strength, I need you to return to me with 10 Dragon Hearts, 10 Dragon Teeth and 10 Mysterious Eyeballs. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002067	You must prove your ability to me.  Go, and show me what you have learned.  I will be watching you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002068	Only those that have the strength and potential to become a Hero, as those who sacrificed their lives to save Madrigal once did, can walk this path.  You must search your soul to see if you are truly ready.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002069	Go and show the world your new power.  I, the Goddess Rhisis, name you a Hero of this world!  A protector of Madrigal!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002070	I, the Goddess Rhisis, cannot be wrong about you.  You must complete the task I have given you in order to become a Hero.  I will be with you, always.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002071	Defeat Masquerpets in the Volkane Dungeon and collect 10 Dragon Hearts, 10 Dragon Teeth and 10 Mysterious Eyeballs to prove to the Goddess Rhisis that you are ready to become a Hero.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002189	Description of quest 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002190	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002191	Welcome to Madrigal!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002192	Welcome, traveler!  By the look of you, I'd say you're getting ready for an adventure, am I right?  Well then you've come to the right place!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002193	There are plenty of dangerous monsters out there to battle, and my shop will help you get prepared for the fight!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002194	You'll be seeing me a lot later on, I'm sure, but for now why don't you pay our local smith Boboko a visit?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002195	Boboko owns the Armor Shop near here, and I think he might have something special for you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002196	Boboko's right nearby, you can't miss him with all the hammering!  Oh, and welcome to Madrigal!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002197	Packing it in so soon?  But the day's just started!  You have so much to do!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002198	Howdy!  Lui told me you'd be coming!  Here, this should help you get started.  Next time you come by, we'll get you underway on your Vagrant training.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002199	Visit Boboko of the Armor Shop to receive a gift.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002200	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002201	Introduction to Armor 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002202	Good to see you again!  Glad to see some new faces in Madrigal, what with all the Masquerpets around.  Let's see what we can do to get you ready to face them.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002203	This is the Armor Shop. Here, you can buy the armor crafted by my family once you meet the requirements for it. There are 4 armor slots in your inventory - Helmet, Suit, Gauntlet, and Boots.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002204	You'll find that different jobs and levels have access to different kinds of armor.  'Course, you probably already knew that.  Now, go talk with my brother Boboku next door at his Weapon Shop.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002205	I know it's loud over here, but didn't you see me pointin'?  Boboku's Weapon Shop is right next door!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002206	You sure?  Well if you change your mind, nobody knows weapons like my brother Boboku.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002207	Well hello there!  Good of you to stop by.  Here, take this, and the next time I see ya we'll get you up to speed on weapons.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002208	Visit Boboko at the Weapon Shop.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002209	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002210	Introduction to Weapons
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002211	Just like armor, weapons differ by the job.  You don't have the experence to wield anything in my shop yet, but look around Madrigal, I'm sure you'll find something.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002212	As a Vagrant, you can use a sword in one hand and a shield in the other.  Equip them by double-clicking them or dragging them into the appropriate slot in your inventory.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002213	Now you're ready to look at shields.  Go see Luda next door at the Shield Shop and he'll take care of you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002214	Luda's Shield Shop is just next door.  Have fun, kid!  Stop by anytime you need a good weapon!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002215	Look, I know it's not as exciting as axes and swords, but you'll need one just the same.  Plus he's got plenty of other stuff for sale, so pay him a visit.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002216	Haha, nice to meet ya, name's Luda!  I'm in charge of shields and other equipment for Vagrants here in Madrigal.  Let's get you set up to fight, shall we?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002217	Visit Luda at the Shield Shop.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002218	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002219	Introcuction to Shields
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002220	Hahaha!  Welcome to the Shield Shop! You can buy shields, weapons, and armor for Vagrants here.  I stock all the equipment that you need prior to your first job change at level 15.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002221	Why don't you buy a Long Sword with the Penya you've collected?  You can buy it by dragging it into your inventory.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002222	Also, you can sell an item by dragging it into the shop window. Pretty easy, huh? Okay, after buying it, please visit Losha at the Food Shop.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002223	Losha at the Food Shop is staying in Eastern Flarine which is located to the east of here. You'll have to cross the bridge to get there.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002224	What, you think it's too far? The Food Shop is very important for your journey, you should definitely check it out.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002225	You are new to Madrigal, right?  Hi! I have heard a lot about you already! Here, take this. It's a gift from Luda. Talk to me again for you next task!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002226	You should buy a Long Sword from Luda at the Shield Shop.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002227	Losha at the Food Shop will give me a Green Shield and 1,200 Penya when I visit her.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002228	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002229	A Vagrant's First Steps (1)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002230	Hello! I am Losha and I run the Food Shop. I sell food that is helpful for when you lose your Health Points (HP). Each type of food has a different recovery power and level requirement.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002231	You can eat the food by double-clicking it in your inventory. Also, you can add them to your hot keys. Please remember that once you eat food, you cannot eat again for a certain amount of time.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002232	Now that the lesson is over it is time for some combat! There are a lot of Aibatts to the north. Please hunt 15 Small Aibatts and go back to Luda at the Shield Shop.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002233	Don't be too nervous and please check your equipment again before you venture out. Oh, and don’t forget to buy some food!!!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002234	This is only your first step into a larger world.  Don't hesitate, go forth and defeat those Small Aibatts!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002235	Great! You completed your task wonderfully! I can see that you will be very famous one day. If you talk to me again, I will give you another task which will be a little bit harder.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002236	You should hunt 15 Small Aibatts. Please check in the quest window (Q Key) and return to Luda at the Shield Shop once you're finished.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002237	Luda at the Shield Shop will give me 1,500 Penya when I hunt 15 Small Aibatts and return to him.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002238	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002239	A Vagrant's First Steps (2)
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002240	I didn’t know that you could accomplish so much this fast! How wonderful! I have one more request for you. There are other monsters around Flarine.  They are called Mushpangs.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002241	Please wipe them out! If you hunt 15 Small Mushpangs and 15 normal Mushpangs, I will give you a reward. Oh, and hold onto any trophies they drop, as they will be very useful in the near future!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002242	Yeah, I knew you could do this!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002243	Mushpangs are very easy for you to hunt! Help protect Flarine from this menace!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002244	It appears there is no monster that can threaten you around Flarine.  It's time for you to step out into the world and show your power! Your adventure has just started!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002245	You didn’t hunt 15 Small Mushpang and 15 Mushpang yet.  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002246	Luda at the Shield Shop will give me 10,000 Penya when I hunt 15 Small Mushpang and 15 Mushpang, and then return to him.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002279	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002280	Cursed!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002281	*psssst!*  Wanna here a scary story?  There once was a craftsman who made the best umbrellas in the world.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002282	They were so popular that he was always sold out! One day, an Evil Lord asked the craftsman to make a special umbrella just for him and the craftsman outright refused!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002283	Enranged, the Evil Lord forbid anyone from buying an umbrella from him. With vengeance in his heart, the craftsman made a deal with Asmodan the Dark!  Shall I continue?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002284	Asmodan put a curse on the Evil Lord with the craftsmans promise that he would never again make another umbrella.  OH NO!!  Now you're cursed! Bring me 2 Charms and 2 Red Candles to remove it!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002285	I know you're dying to hear the rest of my story, aren't you? 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002286	Alright, close your eyes so I can remove the curse --- There, that should do it!  Here, take these Flash Charms.  They will come in handy someday.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002287	You don't have all the items needed to remove the curse. You'd better hurry!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002288	Bring 2 Red Candles and 2 Charms to the Mysterious Teller of Tales to remove the curse!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002289	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002290	Cursed Again!  Lucky you! 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002291	Asmodan cursed the Evil Lord with Never-ending Rain. Madrigal was flooding and the people revolted and banished him! Legend has it that wherever he goes, the rain still follows.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002292	When the craftsman came home his wife was happy to see him, despite their hardships. When asked about making umbrellas again, he said, 'Never again'. Shall I continue?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002293	OH NO!! You're cursed again! If you want me to remove the curse, bring me 2 Red candles and 2 Charms!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002294	You haven't even heard the whole story yet.  You'll be back!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002295	You've got all the items! Great, now let me work my magic. Close your eyes - It's done! Take this Sugar Boost for your protection.  It'll come in handy!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002296	You don't have all the items I need. If you want the curse to end, hurry up and bring me 2 Red candles and 2 Charms.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002297	Bring 2 Red Candles and 2 Charms to the Mysterious Teller of Tales to remove the curse!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002298	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002299	Return of the Curse! 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002300	The craftsman tried making other things but, unfortunately, he was no good at making anything but umbrellas.  His wife begged him to explain why he would not make umbrellas, but he refused to talk about it. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002301	Finally, the wife threatened to leave him unless he started making umbrellas. The craftsman finally gave in to her and made some umbrellas, which he sold in town. When he returned home, his wife was gone.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002302	The craftsman became depressed and eventually lost his mind. No one ever saw him or his wife again.  So, do you want to hear the end?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002303	Oh brother, it looks like you've been cursed again!  You will surely perish unless you bring me 2 Red Candles and 2 Charms. I warn you, this is the last time that I can help you.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002304	Oops, sorry!  I can't tell you the ending of the story, or you'll be cursed forever. Only the craftsman's daughter knows the entire story.  I wonder where who she could be.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002305	Good, you've got all the items. You know the drill, close your eyes --- It's done! Sorry about all the curses, stranger!  Here, take this gift for your troubles.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002306	No, you don't have all the items I need to lift the curse. You must hurry!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002307	Bring 2 Red Candles and 2 Charms to the Mysterious Teller of Tales to remove the curse!

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002533	Protect yourself from Vampires!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002534	Friday the 13th is approaching!  This cursed day will give unheard of strength to the Vampire Lord Drakul.  Luckily I can help you prepare.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002535	I will need 5 pieces of Garlic and 5 Blessed Crosses to forge you a protective necklace. You can get the Garlic from collecting areas. Getting the Blessed Crosses is difficult. You will need to collect them from monsters throughout the land!  
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002536	Bah!  You do not understand the repercussions of your actions.  I am the vampire hunter! If you become infected by the filthy creatures I will have no choice but to hunt you as well!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002537	Your help has been invaluable.  Don't lose that necklace, now.  It's the only thing that will protect you from the vampires!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002538	You need 5 pieces of Garlic from Collection Areas and 5 Blessed Crosses from monsters in order for me to craft you a necklace to ward of the vampires.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002539	Collect 5 pieces of Garlic and 5 Blessed Crosses, and bring them to Van Harlen. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002540	
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002541	Defeat the Vampires!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002542	I was too late to protect everyone from the vampire's bite!  You must help me cure the infected before we are plunged into a world of darkness and evil!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002543	In order to create a cure I will need 10 pieces of Garlic and 10 Blessed Crosses.  You should remember where to get these items.  Please hurry, before all is lost!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002544	You don't want to help?  What are you going to do if everyone is turned into a vampire?!  You can't just turn a blind eye!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002545	This is a good start, take this as a token of my appreciation. I will be able to save a few people with this batch of the cure.  There are many more people who will require help though, please don’t let us down.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002546	You need to hurry before we are outnumbered by these evil creatures. I need 10 pieces of Garlic and 10 Blessed Crosses.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002547	Collect 10 pieces of Garlic and 10 Blessed Crosses, and bring them to Van Harlen.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002621	I have heard that the Monsters of Madrigal have been collecting all of the remaining Snow Flakes.  I need those Snow Flakes fast!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002622	I would go collect Snow Flakes myself but I have no arms and legs.   It would be too difficult for me to even get the upper hand on an Aibatt!
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002623	Collect the Snow Flakes and bring them to me.  If you do, I'll give you a reward.  Will you help?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002624	If you find 10 Snow Flakes then we can avert this crisis! Please hurry before those nasty monsters throw them into a fire!

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002632	Unfortunately, Snow Fairies can only be found traveling with Monsters!  Please, won't you capture 10 Snow Fairies for me?
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002633	Thank you! Please hurry and gather 10 of the Snow Fairies. 
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002634	Oh well. Without harnessing the power of the Snow Fairies, we may never see snow again…
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002635	Thank you very much! We can save winter now! Here is your reward.
IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002636	You do not have enough Snow Fairies for me to save winter. I need 10 'Snow Fairies'.

IDS_PROPQUEST_INC_002651	What? You're not interested in helping me… I bet you just can't find anyone to love you!
